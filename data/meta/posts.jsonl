If that community has a generally accepted answer that is wrong, it is not worth my time to come in and try to change the way the wind blows. I look for communities where, in the context of this example, quality and quality control is respected, and where the members are the kinds of people who have used these cheaper weapons, run them hard on duty and/or in training, had them fail, and \"seen the light\" on quality control for a hard use gun.</p>\n\n<p><em>(That example is not an attempt to start a fight, simply an example of an expert-level opinion I have seen time and time again.

Very few people know/realize this, in my experience. Most people just use the old \"the heavier the bullet is, the higher your twist rate must be,\" yet that's incorrect!
