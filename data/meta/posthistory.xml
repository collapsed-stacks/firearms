Precisely as @dgm answered, people don't know what they don't know. &lt;strong&gt;If we have a foundation of answers that are obviously of expert level, even to simple questions, I believe it would do more to attract experts than if we had either an unknown or known-to-be-poor level of understanding of the basics.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally simply avoid sites where the common answer to a question about AR-15s is &quot;my cheap DPMS is just as good as your expensive LaRue/Bravo Company/LMT/Colt/Noveske/Daniel Defense/Knight's Armament/et al.&quot; because there's no point in arguing. If that community has a generally accepted answer that is wrong, it is not worth my time to come in and try to change the way the wind blows. I look for communities where, in the context of this example, quality and quality control is respected, and where the members are the kinds of people who have used these cheaper weapons, run them hard on duty and/or in training, had them fail, and &quot;seen the light&quot; on quality control for a hard use gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;(That example is not an attempt to start a fight, simply an example of an expert-level opinion I have seen time and time again.

Very few people know/realize this, in my experience. Most people just use the old &quot;the heavier the bullet is, the higher your twist rate must be,&quot; yet that's incorrect! It may be considered by some a technicality, but it lays an expert-level foundation for this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we should take advantage of the ability to create a solid foundation of knowledge based on the small number of expert level answerers we have available to us now to lay the foundation of &lt;strong&gt;actual knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; before the amateur horde arrives in open beta and starts answering questions with the commonly-accepted-but-oh-so-wrong knowledge that's been passed through the amateur gun community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These answers are things that &quot;a simple Google search&quot; could as easily turn up an answer that is wrong as they could turn up an answer that is right just because of the level of bad info that's out there and constantly perpetuated." />

While some states and political subdivisions may further define other items like pellet guns, airsoft, slingshots, etc as weapons, it is too local to be consistent with Q&amp;A. As an example, one state in mind has criminal statutes and environmental statutes that conflict with respect to defining what is a “pistol.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  With a consistent definition of firearms (Title I and Title II), the exchange will avoid the circumstances of providing legal advice as discussed in a previous question in this meta. Having the exchange define “firearms” in too broad a sense will result in diluting the content shared. Generally speaking, many people do not consider other devices firearms unless they propel a projectile by way of an explosive propellant, no matter how a few states may define other projectile weapons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, discussions pertaining to airsoft and the like should be considered O/T, with a caveat...  Plenty of folks use airsoft and other non-lethal firearm facsimiles as training aids to augment their skills with lethal firearms.  Use of these non-lethal items in a training context should be allowed.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Even if we don't shoot them much anymore, a lot of us started out on air guns and still have them around for our children to start out on and/or for dealing with pest animals in areas where discharging a firearm is illegal or inadvisable.  There's even a niche of people who use air guns for hunting.  I propose allowing air gun questions at least for a while during the beta and seeing if the questions seem too far out of place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, I have been wondering why BBs and pellets aim differently out of the same air rifle, and how to compensate for it.
