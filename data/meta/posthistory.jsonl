Precisely as @dgm answered, people don't know what they don't know. <strong>If we have a foundation of answers that are obviously of expert level, even to simple questions, I believe it would do more to attract experts than if we had either an unknown or known-to-be-poor level of understanding of the basics.</strong>\r\n\r\nI personally simply avoid sites where the common answer to a question about AR-15s is \"my cheap DPMS is just as good as your expensive LaRue/Bravo Company/LMT/Colt/Noveske/Daniel Defense/Knight's Armament/et al.\" because there's no point in arguing. If that community has a generally accepted answer that is wrong, it is not worth my time to come in and try to change the way the wind blows. I look for communities where, in the context of this example, quality and quality control is respected, and where the members are the kinds of people who have used these cheaper weapons, run them hard on duty and/or in training, had them fail, and \"seen the light\" on quality control for a hard use gun.\r\n\r\n<em>(That example is not an attempt to start a fight, simply an example of an expert-level opinion I have seen time and time again. It is merely an example, please take it as nothing more.)</em> \r\n\r\nThings as simple as what is the difference between a \"clip\" and a \"magazine\" may seem like a non-expert-level question, yet some self-professed \"experts\" use the term interchangeably. With this site, we have the opportunity to lay a solid foundation of \"beginner-level\" questions that dispel the myths and misinformation in an expert-level way, as well as being able to answer questions that highly knowledgeable people would consider expert-level.\r\n\r\nI'll use my answer to the \"what is twist rate\" question as an example (not to blow my own horn, but because it's front-of-mind for me): twist rate can be explained simply as \"the number of inches of barrel length required for a single revolution of the bullet.\" My answer explained (what I believe to be) an \"expert-level\" bit of knowledge in calling out that the twist rate affects bullets based on their length, and not their weight. Very few people know/realize this, in my experience. Most people just use the old \"the heavier the bullet is, the higher your twist rate must be,\" yet that's incorrect! It may be considered by some a technicality, but it lays an expert-level foundation for this site.\r\n\r\nI think we should take advantage of the ability to create a solid foundation of knowledge based on the small number of expert level answerers we have available to us now to lay the foundation of <strong>actual knowledge</strong> before the amateur horde arrives in open beta and starts answering questions with the commonly-accepted-but-oh-so-wrong knowledge that's been passed through the amateur gun community.\r\n\r\nThese answers are things that \"a simple Google search\" could as easily turn up an answer that is wrong as they could turn up an answer that is right just because of the level of bad info that's out there and constantly perpetuated."}

The question I answered regarding the purchase of NFA firearms or suppressors is not a good example of this as it's a federal level law with differing implementations, but another question about the purchase of a 1911 for a beginner evoked comments about the ability to get a CCW in California. This info can be important in questions regarding modifications and repairs.\r\n\r\n - What is this gun's intended purpose?\r\n\r\n\"Fighting gun or range toy?\" came up multiple times today! These were questions about purchasing firearms but the same could, again, extend to questions asked about modifications, repairs, and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThere was a third piece I thought important but it has slipped my mind, maybe it wasn't important <em>enough</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>How can we convey to our new askers that they need to provide, at a minimum, these pieces of information?</strong>\r\n\r\nCan we customize the FAQ?

While some states and political subdivisions may further define other items like pellet guns, airsoft, slingshots, etc as weapons, it is too local to be consistent with Q&A. As an example, one state in mind has criminal statutes and environmental statutes that conflict with respect to defining what is a \u201cpistol.\u201d\r\n\r\n>  With a consistent definition of firearms (Title I and Title II), the exchange will avoid the circumstances of providing legal advice as discussed in a previous question in this meta. Having the exchange define \u201cfirearms\u201d in too broad a sense will result in diluting the content shared. Generally speaking, many people do not consider other devices firearms unless they propel a projectile by way of an explosive propellant, no matter how a few states may define other projectile weapons.\r\n\r\nIn other words, discussions pertaining to airsoft and the like should be considered O/T, with a caveat...  Plenty of folks use airsoft and other non-lethal firearm facsimiles as training aids to augment their skills with lethal firearms.  Use of these non-lethal items in a training context should be allowed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}

I personally don't consider them to be firearms, but I'm not opposed to considering air guns on topic as long as they are properly tagged.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think they are a good fit for the site is that there is a large overlap in the community and so many of the principles are the same between the subjects.  Even if we don't shoot them much anymore, a lot of us started out on air guns and still have them around for our children to start out on and/or for dealing with pest animals in areas where discharging a firearm is illegal or inadvisable.  There's even a niche of people who use air guns for hunting.  I propose allowing air gun questions at least for a while during the beta and seeing if the questions seem too far out of place.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have been wondering why BBs and pellets aim differently out of the same air rifle, and how to compensate for it.  In my opinion, questions like that don't detract from the expert or serious enthusiast feel of the site."}
