The most important factor is that you can fire the gun comfortably and accurately. The best way to find this is to try firing several types of guns - some ranges will rent various models of guns to you to try, and some have classes where you can try several different types of guns. Your local gun clubs may also be able to help you out.\r\n\r\nThe next factor is to get effective ammunition for the weapon. Effective ammunition is generally available in calibers 9mm and up. Bigger calibers may be more effective, but have more recoil, which can make you shoot more slowly and less accurately. Also remember that common calibers, like 9mm and 45ACP generally have cheaper practice ammunition available. You should use JHP for personal defense for reasons best covered in another question. Speer Gold Dot and Winchester Ranger are generally considered good brands of JHP.\r\n\r\nAs for types of weapon, semi-autos are more effective because they hold more ammunition and are easier to reload, however, you need to practice more to know how to load and unload them. If you know you won't be able to practice a lot, a revolver is a good choice because it is easy to see if it is loaded or not.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind also that any bullet powerful enough to reliably stop an attacker is also powerful enough to penetrate several walls and cause serious injury to anyone on the other side. There is no way around this. It is thus best to use lights to make sure you can see the attacker, arrange your home and defense plan in such a way that no innocents are in the line of fire, and practice enough that your shots are as accurate as possible."}

SA handguns require you to cock the gun, either by drawing back the hammer or by racking the slide to the rear yourself.  There are some handguns that are SA or DA meaning you can fire them in either manner, whichever is most comfortable for you.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that SA/DA handguns will have a heavier trigger pull when you shoot DA than if you cock it manually and then shoot."}

The kit includes:\r\n> \r\n>  - APEX Hard Sear (9 mm, .357 Sig & .40 series) - NOT FOR .45 ACP APEX\r\n>  - M&P Ultimate Striker Block Kit (USB kit) APEX M&P Increased Rate Sear\r\n>  - Spring & Trigger Return Spring (aluminum slave pin included)\r\n\r\nAs they say on the site in the detailed description, this will not change the pre-load on the trigger, also called up-take or pre-travel. Apex makes a kit that will change these but recommends it for only competition use.\r\n\r\nAnother product available from Apex is called the <a href=\"https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid44.html\">RAM</a>. From their site:\r\n\r\n> The Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (Patent Pending) is a drop in part\r\n> engineered to improve tactile trigger reset of your M&P pistol.  Along\r\n> with improving the felt reset, the Apex RAM also serves as a failsafe\r\n> in the unlikely event of a Trigger Return Spring breakage; keeping the\r\n> trigger bar properly positioned under the sear and allowing the user\r\n> to manually manipulate the trigger forward between shots.\r\n"}

Just treat the metal to prevent further rusting and carry on. \r\n\r\nThere are many treatments such as Duracoat and Cerakote that will allow you to recover metal parts of a firearm. You can apply these as needed and they are easier to deal with than rebluing or reanodizing metal parts. \r\n\r\nIf you truly want to restore the original finish of a firearm with bluing, you can find gunsmiths who will do this for you. It is a labor-intensive process, and can be quite expensive. The coating mentioned earlier can be applied by you in your home, and even the bake-on ones can be baked on in your own kitchen oven. \r\n\r\nFrom the site of <a href=\"http://www.ahlmans.com/metalfinishing.html\">a gunsmith</a> who does rebluing: \r\n\r\n> Rebluing is more than restoring the color of your gun.  It is a\r\n> complete overhaul.  We start by completely disassembling the gun. \r\n> Then the gun is buffed completely to remove any scratches or rust pits\r\n> and restoring all corners and edges to \"factory new\" sharpness.  Then\r\n> it is polished to a bright luster for better appearance.  The gun is\r\n> then boiled in a special solution which removes every trace of dirt,\r\n> and blued to a deep black color.  Finally we reassemble and function\r\n> test the gun.  The result is a gun which in most cases looks \"better\r\n> than new\".\r\n\r\nNot all gunsmiths may take the pride in their work that this particular one does. They may not do the polishing prior to bluing, or the resharpening of edges to remove signs of wear. And if you're not worried about a new-gun look that may be fine. But be aware that truly restoring the bluing to a firearm is an intensive process. \r\n\r\nI personally have had anodized parts that needed machining (AR15 lowers), and after machining I simply covered them with duracoat and they've had no issues. It may be that these will be the easiest way to restore the appearance and protection to the metal."}

Get the basics first. Safe handling and storage, legal issues in your locale and basic shooting proficiency. Any class that does not include a range component should be avoided, because it is simply not practical.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to acquire concealed carry permits, it may be important depending on where you live, to take a particular kind of course with a particular kind of certificate at the end. Many states require proof of proficiency, which you can sometimes provide with such a certificate. This is a highly localized thing, so you will have to research that independently.\r\n\r\nAs an NRA member, I am biased towards taking classes from them. My first training class was run by a local shooting range, and provided a training certificate at the end. The course covered all the basics of firearms safety, as well as components on the use of deadly force, anatomy of different kinds of firearms, etc. The course included several nights of classroom instruction, and three days at the range.

Some kids should never be around guns regardless of education, but most kids I've ever been around have enough mental and emotional stability that they would have no problem with them as long as they have the proper education and supervision.

Just make sure whatever you choose opens reliably on demand and doesn't have a lot of points of failure (something the GunVault brand has been prone to historically, though I'm not sure about their current quality)."}

Make sure it's unloaded and always, always watch your muzzle direction!\r\n\r\nGet the cylinder swung open, removed or whatever else it takes to get to a point where you see the back of the barrel.\r\n\r\nExternal once-over - look for:\r\n\r\n* Boogered screws.\r\n\r\n* Cracks: pay particular attention to the back of the barrel and the frame where the barrels goes in.\r\n\r\n* Proper fit at any place there's metal-to-metal edges.\r\n\r\n* Look under the \"topstrap\" just over the barrel for signs of flame-cutting.  A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate\r\nwear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small \"heat shield\" has gone missing!\r\n\r\n* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, esp. near the muzzle. Look for signs of\r\ncracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.\r\n\r\n* Look at the cylinder's \"star\" at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.\r\n\r\n* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.\r\n\r\nWith the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is \"full lockup\" - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:\r\n\r\n* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barre) - that's endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is\r\nOK, esp. with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (esp.\r\naluminum/scandium/magnesium) it's a scary thing.\r\n\r\n* Check for \"rotational wiggle\".  A little is OK on S&Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.\r\nUmm...except for those crazy Matebas and Rhinos, I have no clue on those :).  On double-action Colt revolvers there's\r\nsupposed to be zero rotational play.\r\n\r\n* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  UNLOAD it.\r\nYou want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a \"circle behind a circle\"\r\neffect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the \"loose rotational lockup\" guns (S&W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's\r\npossible to \"nudge\" the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.\r\n\r\n* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is\r\nminimal, .003\" to .004\" optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006\" I'd be\r\nunhappy with it.\r\n\r\n* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's\r\nnext \"click\".\r\n\r\n* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  \r\n\r\n* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer\r\nbar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.\r\n\r\n* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger \"transfer bar pinch\" issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc."}

Also, it'e pretty rare for fixed sights on a modern pistol to be very far off and if you really care about minute accuracy adjustments, you're probably in the custom gun, capable of doing this on your own level. \r\n\r\nSome general advice:\r\nFirst off, do everything you can to guarantee as much repeatability as possible. You could use a bench or a rest of some sort, or go crazy and get something like a [Ransom Rest][1]. Assuming you are adjusting fixed pistol sights that are in a dovetail, you will also need some sort of sight adjustment tool to move the rear sight.\r\n\r\n 1. Fire several rounds from your stable position. This is your baseline.\r\n 2. If the shots landed to the left of where you were aiming, move either the rear sight to the right or the front sight to the left. If the shots landed to the right of where you were aiming, move either the rear sight to the left or the front sight to the right.\r\n 3. Fire another shot or two to see the results of step 2.\r\n\r\nIn general, you should only move the rear sight, not the front. Also, it isn't easy to change elevation (shots landing above of below point-of-aim) on a pistol with fixed sights. It is possible, but often involves changing out parts or filling in the dovetail under the sights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ransomrest.com/RansomRest.html"}

We have never had an issue with rounds that have not had bullet angle compromised.\r\n\r\nWe can do this in the military because we have quality rifles (Colt M4s, FN Herstal M16s) and use quality ammunition. If your rifle is of questionable specification or low quality (DPMS, Bushmaster, Rock River), or the ammo is not an acceptable quality factory ammo (Tula, Wolf, steel cased) or has an unknown history (reloads you bought from a friend with no idea how many times the brass has been reloaded) then I would advise against shooting it.\r\n\r\nIf the crimp is bad enough to get the bullet pointing in a direction that is not straight forward, we toss the rounds and don't use them. Not because they're a safety hazard (although they may be) but because they generally will never feed properly again, which makes them annoying. We also toss rounds that have been so badly damaged that the metal has a hard crease (think like a crease in your pants, not just a dent). Hard-creased rounds have generally been damaged in more places than just the spot where the crease is, and the neck where the bullet seats is often lose and allows the bullet to move if pressed on. Also not good for feeding, and if the bullet falls out it makes a mess of powder and the lose bullet jams things up.\r\n\r\nGenerally I wouldn't worry too much about the round having some ill effect on your gun if something bad were to happen at the point of the crimp. The neck of the cartridge and the entire body of the cartridge is supported all around by the chamber of the rifle."}

For ammunition that you must rely on, if you have chambered a round once and have to remove it from the chamber, throw it away.</b>\r\n\r\nIn the AR15 platform, the floating firing pin inside the bolt will repeatedly strike the primer of the round. 5.56mm ammunition uses hard primers so that the light strikes from the firing pin do not cause problems. \r\n\r\nThe problems arises when the primer is lightly struck repeatedly. The primers will be more and more prone to failure with each strike, even after a very small number of chamberings. The LAPD SWAT department had two documented issues with this, one a misfire during a raid and one when they went to the range to fire the rest of their ammunition in an attempt to diagnose the problem. \r\n\r\nIf you are not depending on this ammunition to do your job or save your life (home defense, police, military, hunting, etc.) then you are fine with taking the chance of a misfire. For shooting at the range and just for fun there is no issue with rechambering rounds repeatedly.\r\n\r\nRepeated chamberings also carry the risk of bullet setback, where the bullet is pushed farther back inside the casing. This can cause various problems and should definitely be avoided. If the bullet is lose or you can see a gap between the edge of the casing and the side of the bullet, toss it. The bullet setback is a bigger deal than the primer strikes. "}

NATO test barrels made for 5.56mm NATO measure chamber pressure at the case mouth, as opposed to the location used by the United States civil standards organization SAAMI.

I store my rifles and hand guns in a gun safe in the house. My kids don't know the combination, and never go near it. NO ammunition is stored in that safe, the ammunition is stored in a completely different safe in the garage (a small handgun safe) that requires a KEY AND 4 digit electronic lock/combo. The key is hidden, so the possibility of them getting their hands on a firearm, and ammunition together while technically possible is highly unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe second part education, is to show them the firearms in a controlled environment, teach them how to determine if they're loaded, etc. The biggest thing is to teach them that guns can KILL, and they're always to be pointed and handled in a safe manner despite the fact if they're loaded or not. I try to teach them to pretend that the gun could just go off at any time and to assume they're loaded.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 12, I took a hunter's safety education course in Washington state. They brought a bunch of us kids up there (our parents were there too) and passed a loaded mousetrap with us. Every kid... including me was very careful to pass it to the next, etc. Then... they passed us a German Luger. There were some stupid ass kids there, pointing it at people, etc. etc. I was the only one to point it in a safe direction. But I think you see the point they were trying to make... later my Dad told me that they had told all the parents about the 'drill' and of course the weapon was not loaded with ammunition."}

In particular, if a pistol has a decocking lever, manually decocking it by pulling the trigger and lowering the hammer may not engage all of the internal safeties, leaving the pistol in a state that is not drop safe (this is the case for SIGs)."}

If your hand or finger should slip from the hammer, it will fall forward under the tension of the hammer spring. Depending on how far back it was before slipping this presents the very real possibility that you will negligently discharge a round into whatever the weapon is pointed at.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you must decock your weapon and it doesn't have a decocker, the only truly safe way to do it is to unload it first. With an empty chamber, there is no possibility for discharge.</strong> \r\n\r\nDecocking a weapon that does not have a built in decocker is almost never necessary. Some people do it to prevent wear on the springs, but springs weaken by cycling, not by being under constant load. Some people do it because it's \"safer\" (like my father), but on most weapons with a thumb safety, engaging the thumb safety engages a firing pin safety while decocking prevents the safety from being activated. If you were to have a round in the chamber and smack the hammer hard enough, the gun will fire from this decocked state. One notable exception to this is the older \"Series 70\" style 1911s that have no firing pin safety: even with the thumb safety engaged if you drop them on their hammers they can and have fired.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of decocking a handgun is to do one of two things: first, to put the first trigger pull of a single- and double-action (SA/DA) weapon into double action mode; second, to put a single-action-only (SAO) pistol into a non-operable state.\r\n\r\nPistols like most standard Sigs have no thumb safeties, and carrying them chambered and cocked is considered unsafe. Having them decocked with a very heavy initial trigger pull is considered to be the proper way to carry a pistol of this type. Pistols like most HKs (with their non-DAO trigger packs) support both thumb safeties for cocked-and-locked (loaded, chambered, cocked, and on safe) carry and use, being on safe and decocked, or being decocked and on fire.\r\n\r\nPistols that are double-action-only (DAO) can not have a decocker, as they are never cocked except when halfway through their firing cycle (pulling the trigger will both cock and fire the gun, returning it to a decocked state \u2014 in this way, perhaps the trigger could be considered the decocker)."}

The reason you hear of the help in accuracy is because if you\r\n    chamber barrel with a reamer that has a dull throater instead of cutting\r\n    clean sharp rifling it smears a burr up on the down wind side of the\r\n    rifling.  It takes from 1 to 2 hundred rounds to burn this bur out and\r\n    the rifle to settle down and shoot its best.  Any one who chambers rifle\r\n    barrels has tolerances on how dull to let the reamer get and factories\r\n    let them go longer than any competent smithe would.  Another tidbit to\r\n    consider, Take a 300Win Mag. that has a life expectancy of 1000 rounds. \r\n    Use 10% of it up with your break in procedure for ever 10 barrels the\r\n    barrel maker makes he has to make one more just to take care of the\r\n    break in. no wonder barrel makers like to see this.  Now when you flame\r\n    me on this please include what you think is happening to the inside of\r\n    your barrel during the break in that is helping you.\r\n    \r\n    Gale McMillan\r\n    NBSRA IBS,FCSA and NRA Life Member\r\n\r\nAnd yet on the websites of various other barrel makers, we find long and elaborate procedures for breaking in barrels, claiming to have the benefit of easier cleaning, greater accuracy, and improved barrel life. From barrel maker <a href=\"\">Lilja Precision</a>:\r\n\r\n> We recommend that your new Lilja rifle barrel be properly broken-in to\r\n> obtain the best accuracy. A proper break-in will help ensure that your\r\n> barrel will clean easily in the future and that you will achieve\r\n> maximum accuracy potential. Please follow these important\r\n> instructions.\r\n> \r\n> We are concerned with two types of fouling: copper fouling, which is\r\n> caused by bullet jacket material being left in the barrel, and powder\r\n> fouling. During the first few rounds a lot of copper fouling will be\r\n> left in the barrel. It is important to remove this fouling completely,\r\n> after each shot, to help prevent a build-up later on. Powder fouling\r\n> is ongoing, but easy to remove. Do not use moly-coated bullets during\r\n> the break-in procedure.\r\n\r\nAnd again from Krieger Barrels we have <a href=\"http://www.kriegerbarrels.com/Break_In__Cleaning-c1246-wp2558.htm\">a third story</a> regarding not the bore, but the throat (left as an exercise for the reader).\r\n\r\nSo what's the answer to the question of barrel break-in?

Human beings are not meant to have a small explosion go off in their hand.  When we're forced to do so, we tend to want to get it over with as quickly as possible, hence the jerk.  Unfortunately, all that extra pull on the trigger throws off our point of aim (usually low and to the left for a right-handed shooter).\r\n\r\nThe way to avoid jerking the trigger is to use what is called the surprise break.  In the surprise break we press the trigger slowly to the rear so that we don't know the exact moment it's going to go off.  That way we don't have a chance to jerk or flinch until the shot has already left the barrel.\r\n\r\nThere are several techniques to combat trigger jerk and help you achieve a surprise break.  First, do lots of dry fire practice (working the gun's trigger without any ammunition in the gun).  Concentrate on pressing the trigger straight back, slowly increasing the pressure until it breaks and the gun goes off.  Second is the ball and dummy drill.  Get some dummy rounds in your caliber (also called snap caps) and load a magazine with a mixture of live ammunition and dummy rounds.  It's best if you get someone else to load the magazine, but if you're at the range by yourself you can load several magazines and randomly select one.  The idea is that you won't know whether the round in the chamber is a live one or a dummy.  If you jerk the trigger on a dummy round, it will be obvious because the barrel dips down when the striker falls.  Keep racticing these drills and you can beat that trigger jerking problem."}

You take it out day one and you can't even FIND where you're shooting. It certainly isn't the target. How many squirrels must die before you learn how to aim it at the proper place? That's ok, squirrels are tasty.\r\n\r\nZeroing a rifle is when you center the rifle's point of aim exactly on the either the crosshairs of the scope or your center of the point of aim on your sights. Basically, if you pull the trigger, does the bullet land exactly where your crosshairs were pointing? If not, your gun is NOT zeroed!\r\n\r\nSo how do I zero my rifle?\r\n\r\nSo, you shoot your rifle at a target. You have NO idea where it landed. What do you do?\r\n\r\nFirst. Bore sight. When you shoot your rifle in an open field at a target you will see NOTHING unless you got it on the target. What if you never got it on the target? Not your fault, but guns are NOT accurate right out of the box. The bullet will land wherever the barrel or BORE is pointing, not counting trajectory. The problem is how do you know where your BORE is pointing? Your scope is supposed to tell you that. It first needs to be calibrated. That is what 'zero'ing your rifle really is. It's calibrating your scope to your rifle. Now, in our scenario we are shooting in an open field against a target that has the sky as a backdrop. You cannot see where your bullets are landing because they're not on target. Therefore, you have no way of knowing if your bullets are too high, low, left, or right.\r\n\r\nWhat if you could look down the bore of your rifle *AND* look through the scope at the same time. That would make it SUPER easy to see if they lined up. Too bad our eyes aren't on stalks. We have the next best thing. We can make the bore TELL us where it's pointing. This is the bore sight. This is accomplished by virtually any gun dealer in the country. It can also be done by you in your own home if you have a bore sight yourself. They're fairly cheap and can run as low as $20 at any place like Sportsman's Warehouse. A bore sight is inserted either into the chamber (if the bore sight is shaped like a round) or into the end of the muzzle. It's a laser. It does nothing but point straight ahead. Once that's in there, turn it on and then adjust your windage and elevation until that laser is pointing right on your crosshairs. Bore sight done!\r\n\r\nYour scope is NOT accurate and is NOT calibrated aka NOT zeroed! Why not? That laser was lined up PERFECTLY with the crosshairs! The problem is, the laser is CLOSE to where the bore is really pointing. Right now, chances are your bullets will land ON THE TARGET. That is what we want!\r\n\r\nSo what now?\r\n\r\nWe zero it manually! First a lesson on what Minute of Angle (MOA) is. MOA is equal to 1 inch at 100 yards. So if you are shooting 1 inch left of the bullseye, you are 1 MOA left. Your most common scope has an adjustment level of 1/4 MOA. This means if you turn your windage 4 notches left, you have moved your point of impact 1 inch in that direction if you are shooting on a target 100 yards away. 500 yards away? 4 clicks is going to move you 5 inches. 1000 yards? 10 inches.\r\n\r\nSo, you're aiming at your target. Bore sight was finished long ago. You pull your trigger. Individual rounds don't count. Only where your GROUPS are. With that in mind, make 2 more shots. How close are your rounds to EACH OTHER? If they are close, that means you're shooting accurately. Your RIFLE isn't, but you're doing the work properly. Find the CENTER of your shot group. You look through the scope after you recover from the recoil and you see your group 2.5 inches UP and 3 inches LEFT of your target. Most people say to work on windage first, then work on elevation (or vice versa) but not both at the same time. I agree with this just because it prevents you from mixing things up. Let's hit windage first. Your group is 3 inches to the left. You need to move it 3 inches to the right in order for it to be directly vertical to your bullseye. If 4 clicks means 1 inch at 100 yards, how are you going to move your shot group to the right? 12 clicks right should do it. Take another 3 shots and repeat until your groups are perfectly vertical of the bullseye.\r\n\r\nNow, you have to move the round DOWN until you're on target. If done properly, your round is now 2.5 inches above the bullseye and perfectly centered horizontally. Let's move your round onto the bullseye. 2.5 inches, 4 clicks per inch, you're looking at 4 x 2.5 = 10 clicks. Move your scope down 10 clicks. 3 more shots. Is your shot group on the bullseye? If not, repeat until it is. If it *IS* on the bullseye, congratulations! You've just zeroed your rifle for the 100 year line! You can now say with confidence that with the current settings, your groups should always be spot on assuming YOU are doing YOUR job with the aiming.\r\n\r\nThese settings are always your starting point when shooting at other distances as well. Let's take the 300 yard line as an example. If you point your rifle down range at a target 300 yards away and pull the trigger, since you haven't changed your zero (also called your dope), you should still be SPOT ON, right? No. When you throw a baseball, does it fly in a perfectly straight line? No, it drops more the further it flies. This is the trajectory. Bullets are definitely not immune to the laws of physics. (\"Obey physics... IT'S THE LAW!\") You need to use your elevation to compensate for this bullet drop. Here is a table for 155gr .308.\r\n\r\n    RANGE   DROP\r\n    100     0\"\r\n    200     2.87\"\r\n    300     11.2\"\r\n    400     25.6\"\r\n    500     46.9\"\r\n    600     76.0\"\r\n    700    114.9\"\r\n    800    161.7\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means if you are shooting at 300 yards, your bullet will hit 11.2 inches below the target. You have to move it 11.2 inches UP. We know that 4 clicks is 1 inch at 100 yards. If we're moving it 11.2 inches, that means 45 clicks up right? NO! At 300 yards, 4 clicks is THREE inches. You need to take it up about 15 clicks. If 1 click = 1/4 in at 100 yards, then it equals 3/4 inch at 300 yards.\r\n\r\nSo your zero at 100 yards gives you a baseline. If you move to the 300 yard line, you have to move your round up 11.2 inches if using a 155gr .308. If you move to the 700 yard line, be prepared to move your round up 76.0 inches. Obviously different sized bullets, different amounts of powder, and different calibers will give you slightly different results.\r\n\r\nWind also has drastic effects on the bullet. The further out your target is, the longer the wind has to affect the path of your bullet, pushing it left or right. Wind coming STRAIGHT AT YOU or wind that is traveling WITH the bullet do not have a measurable effect on the path of the bullet. Only wind coming from the side in any measurable fashion. The amount that you will have to adjust varies very widely depending on the size of the bullet, the caliber of the round, and the amount of powder propelling it. That is far beyond the scope of this article.\r\n\r\nFor extra information (or if you're not yet confused enough), check this link:\r\n\r\nhttp://demigodllc.com/articles/practical-long-range-rifle-shooting-optics/\r\n\r\nThe above article is copied almost ver batim from something written by me over here:  http://www.utahconcealedcarry.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=11301  Copy and use the information however you want!"}

What is important is the twist rate of the rifling, generally specified in number of inches for a full rotation. You can calculate a stability factor for a bullet given the bullet weight, caliber, length, muzzle velocity, and barrel twist rate, plus the temperature and pressure of the air where you are firing. All else being equal, longer bullets, lower twist rates, and lower atmospheric temperatures and altitudes make bullets less stable. Generally, once the stability is above the limit, the bullet will fly straight, and there is no benefit to adding more stability. If the stability is below the limit, then the bullet will tumble in flight and generally be wildly inaccurate.\r\n\r\nFor common calibers firing factory loads, this is generally not an issue, as they are all pre-calculated to be stable in all ordinary conditions. The only somewhat common case I know of where this is a problem is for firing M855 or 62 grain bullets in AR15s with the early-model 1 in 12 inch twist barrels. Doing this will reportedly result in group sizes of 1-2 **feet** at 100 yards. If you are doing custom work with unusual ammunition types or calibers, then you should calculate your own stability factors to verify stability.\r\n\r\nSome links for more information:\r\n\r\n[Stability Calculator][1]\r\n\r\n[AR15.com ammo FAQ with more detailed description][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmstab-5.1.cgi\r\n  [2]: http://ammo.ar15.com/ammo/project/perf_twists.html"}

Sometimes for more money, sometimes as part of the regular price. At almost all levels of shooting this is not something that needs to be worried about, and more focus should be paid to the twist rate. To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.\r\n\r\n#Bullet stability and twist rate\r\nTwist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through.

In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.</strong> \r\n\r\nEarly AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior.\r\n\r\n#Bullet stability and the number of lands/grooves\r\nThe number of lands and grooves in a barrel is not impoartant, but the surface area ratio between the land width and groove width is.

If you're in the mood for a serious custom stock, try searching for \"gun fitting\". At least one place quoted $250 and about 2 hours to get measurements, though I believe once you have them, they're not likely to change much on an adult. That being said, for a Mossberg 500, I'm guessing you want a fast, relatively inexpensive fix. \r\n\r\nTo get a rough idea how much you may need to cutoff or enlarge for your \"Length Of Pull\", with the understanding that there's really more too it and it may still not be quite right, you can use the following:\r\n\r\n[ricciardelli on reloaders nest](http://www.reloadersnest.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2581)\r\n> Correct LOP can be determined by placing the buttstock along your forearm. Slip your trigger finger onto the trigger and the rest of your fingers around the pistol grip or wrist just like you would do if you were shouldering the rifle. Look down and see if the face of the butt plate or butt pad rests against your biceps.\r\n\r\n> If it is just touching the surface of your biceps then the LOP is very close to being correct. You can further test for a correct LOP by shouldering the rifle and relaxing your right arm and letting your elbow drop as low as possible without being uncomfortable. Your elbow should be approximately in the centreline of the side of your body.\r\n\r\n> If it's too far forward the LOP is too long. If it's too far rearward, the LOP is too short. These tests are just initial indicators of correct LOP. Because of variations in shooting styles you may still need to lengthen or shorten the buttstock to gain a correct fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, if you prefer the traditional style and don't feel like cutting, Choate has a synthetic replacement that will let you adjust from 13-14\" LOP in 1/2\" increments for about $70. If you prefer a pistol grip, there are adapters and or full kits that will allow you to use AR15 collapsible/adjustable stocks and they run from $60 - $300 depending on what you get."}

Federal has designed a new #1 buckshot specifically for use in \"law enforcement\": Federal #1 buckshot, 15 pellet, 1100 fps \"Flight Control\" load (LE132-1B). When fired out of a generic 18\" 870P, into bare gel, all 15 of the 30 caliber plated pellets penetrated in the 14-18 inch range.

A caveat: if you already had all the info you would need to calculate this, it would seem that you're in the process of manufacturing and selling bullets. Getting all that info is much more difficult than just reading the BC printed on the box of bullets or reading it online if you're buying whole cartridges.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note that the BC only refers to the bullet, which is a single piece of the cartridge or round. Nomenclature is key here, as in this context \"bullet\" does not mean the casing, primer, powder charge, and bullet combined, or the many possible combinations of same. <em>Only</em> the bullet.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe detailed equation for calculating the ballistic coefficient of bullets is below, with an explanation of the variables available on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient#Bullet_performance\">Wikipedia</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/c/4/9/c494b0416825cdc5fa71474121f6dfa0.png\" alt=\"Ballistic Coefficient Formula\" />\r\n\r\nThe BC is not affected by the twist rate of a barrel, which affects the stability of the round in flight. Although an unstable bullet's BC will be terrible, as long as the bullet is stable the BC will stay the same. If 62gr ammo from an AR-15 is stabilized by a 1:9 twist, its BC will be the same as if it were stabilized by a 1:7 or 1:8 twist, only changing when stability is lost.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the BC is not affected by velocity, but velocity affects stability. In other words, the higher your initial velocity, the longer \u2014 or farther \u2014 a bullet in flight can remain stable. It is also unaffected by powder type or charge."}

This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.</strong> Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting.\r\n\r\nSimply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. <strong>Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.</strong> To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting.

A 1:7 (\"one-in-seven\") twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability\">Greenhill Formula</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png\" alt=\"The Greenhill Formula\" />\r\n\r\n - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\r\n - D = bullet's diameter in inches\r\n - L = bullet's length in inches\r\n - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\r\n\r\nNote that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. <strong>The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.</strong> \r\n\r\nEarly AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior."}

The 1:7 will stabilize ALL but the lightest, most specialized loads, while the 1:9 will NOT stabilize heavier and very common self defense loads.", "Text": "<strong>The best all-around twist rates for AR-15 rifles is 1 twist per 7 inches of barrel length, or 1:7. This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.</strong> Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting.\r\n\r\nSimply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. <strong>Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.</strong> To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.\r\n\r\n#Bullet stability and twist rate\r\nTwist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (\"one-in-seven\") twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability\">Greenhill Formula</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png\" alt=\"The Greenhill Formula\" />\r\n\r\n - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\r\n - D = bullet's diameter in inches\r\n - L = bullet's length in inches\r\n - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\r\n\r\nNote that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. <strong>The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.</strong> \r\n\r\nEarly AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior."}

Make sure your family knows that if something is going bad \u2014 strange noises in the dark, etc. \u2014 that they should either stay put or come directly to you.\r\n\r\nThere are a few schools of thought when using a weapon-light (or a flashlight and a weapon together). The one I've seen most often is based on treating the light like its own weapon. Just as you would shoot, move, and communicate in a combat situation you should consider your light as \"shooting,\" and each time you finish shooting you must move. Lights and gunshots both give away your position. Communication can be to your significant other, to your children, to anybody you are working with (perhaps a roommate or other family members who are with you).\r\n\r\nIf your light is mounted to your weapon, remember that anything you want to illuminate is having a gun pointed at them. If you hear a noise from your daughter's room and point the light at the door to see her coming out, you're pointing a gun at your daughter. Remember this when employing your light. If you have a weapon light you can use the cone of the light rather than the center for inspecting noises in places your family might be (another reason it's important they either stay put or come <em>directly</em> to you). Or you can use a light that isn't mounted to your weapon. Independent lights compromise your grip and control of the weapon but give you a greater level of safety and mobility when inspecting your home. There are trade-offs in all things. I prefer weapon mounted lights.\r\n\r\nTraining is vital. I can assure you from experience as a US Marine that people will not and can not \"rise to the occasion\" like they do in TV and movies. You will default to your most solid level of training. You won't suddenly have this part of your brain kick on because your family is at risk, imbuing you with heightened levels of skill. You must train to be proficient.\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer that if you pick up a gun, you do so because you are prepared to kill somebody. If you're not prepared to kill somebody, find something else. A bat, some mace, whatever. <strong>If you are going to shoot somebody, do not fire warning shots, do not shoot to wound, and do not second guess yourself.</strong> If you're uncomfortable with the idea of killing somebody that's good: It means you're not a psychopath. But be prepared to do it, and accept that by using a gun you may have to kill in order to protect you and your family.\r\n\r\nWith that said, very bright lights can be deterrents. They have a blinding and disorienting effect on people when you go from pitch black to 200 lumens directly in your eyes. Conversely, some people don't react to this as badly as others, and while their night vision will be totally blasted, there's a very very bright light that acts as a great target indicator.\r\n\r\nSide note about home defense: A common myth is that racking a round into your shotgun will cause criminals to flee in terror. Don't count on it. Does it work? Yeah, sometimes. Does it work very often? No, not really. In police and other law enforcement circles, it's relatively well known that it rarely works. What it does do, every time, is telegraph your position and your intentions, and remove the element of surprise.\r\n\r\nIt's very important that you know your house. That you know corners that provide good lines of sight. That you know the dead space where somebody could hide if they see you coming (like behind a couch in the middle of your living room, for example), that you know the common points of entry and exit to your home that may not be a door."}

If you have adults that would be arming themselves as well, you need to get team training so someone isn't accidentally shot in the back.

I would start by looking for a [good low-light training class][1].\r\n\r\nOn the hardware side of things, I agree with Xander that a good hand held light is the place to start.  Not only does it allow you to illuminate things without pulling your gun on them, it also can deter thugs and makes a handy impact weapon.  It's particularly nice because, not being a 'weapon' you can have it in your hand, ready to go under a much wider array of circumstances than you could a pistol or knife.  When I'm walking through a dark parking lot I've got my Surefire in my hand ready to go.  Heck, you can even take it on airplanes!\r\n\r\nI prefer tube lights, with momentary tailcap switches.  A light with multiple modes, or that clicks on and off is a recipe for disaster in a fight.  The last thing you want is your light getting stuck on, or being set to the wrong brightness setting.  In the midst of a fight or flight reaction I want a light where I can mash down on the tailcap to get light and let my thumb up to turn it off.  My current favorite is the Surefire G2X; plenty of power, stupid simple tailcap switch.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.suarezinternationalstore.com/lowlightgunfighting.aspx"}

I prefer weapon mounted lights.\r\n\r\n#Training is vital.\r\nI can assure you from experience as a US Marine that people will not and can not \"rise to the occasion\" like they do in TV and movies. You will default to your most solid level of training. You won't suddenly have this part of your brain kick on because your family is at risk, imbuing you with heightened levels of skill. You must train to be proficient.\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer that if you pick up a gun, you do so because you are prepared to kill somebody. If you're not prepared to kill somebody, find something else. A bat, some mace, whatever. <strong>If you are going to shoot somebody, do not fire warning shots, do not shoot to wound, and do not second guess yourself.</strong> If you're uncomfortable with the idea of killing somebody that's good: It means you're not a psychopath. But be prepared to do it, and accept that by using a gun you may have to kill in order to protect you and your family.\r\n\r\nWith that said, very bright lights can be deterrents. They have a blinding and disorienting effect on people when you go from pitch black to 200 lumens directly in your eyes. Conversely, some people don't react to this as badly as others, and while their night vision will be totally blasted, there's a very very bright light that acts as a great target indicator.\r\n\r\nIt's very important that you know your house. That you know corners that provide good lines of sight. That you know the dead space where somebody could hide if they see you coming (like behind a couch in the middle of your living room, for example), that you know the common points of entry and exit to your home that may not be a door.\r\n\r\n<em>Side note about home defense: A common myth is that racking a round into your shotgun will cause criminals to flee in terror. Don't count on it. Does it work? Yeah, sometimes. Does it work very often? No, not really. In police and other law enforcement circles, it's relatively well known that it rarely works. What it does do, every time, is telegraph your position and your intentions, and remove the element of surprise.</em>\r\n"}

This is a fully jacketed lead bullet (meaning it has a copper outer shell).  Commonly used for practice.  The military generally uses FMJ exclusively due to the Hague Convention of 1899's prohibition on expanding bullets.\r\n\r\n* Soft point: A bullet with an exposed lead tip designed to expand as it passes through the target.  Generally seen on hunting ammo in rifle calibers.\r\n\r\n* Hollowpoint: Also known as a Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP).  Bullets with an open hole in the tip designed to expand as they pass through the target.  The expansion produces greater damage in the target, as well as making it less likely that the bullet will pass completely through the target and overpenetrate.  Seen in both pistol and rifle calibers.  Generally the best choice for self defense.\r\n\r\n* Ballistic tip: A bullet with a soft plastic tip.  Ballistic tips are often applied to hollowpoints to make them more aerodynamic.  However, not all ballistic tip bullets are designed to expand.  Some match target bullets, like the Hornady A-MAX line, have ballistic tips for aerodynamic reasons even though they are not designed for expansion.  Ballistic tips are also seen on some ammunition intended for use in tube fed lever action rifles, to avoid setting off the primer of the round in front of it.  "}

Mid-length gas systems are 9\" long, rifle-length systems are 12\" long.\r\n\r\nThe US Military uses carbine- and rifle- length systems on the M4 (14.5\" barrel) and M16 (20\" barrel), respectively. Almost all ARs built use one of the three (carbine, mid, and rifle) popular lengths. Pistol is used for extremely short barreled rifles, or \"pistol\" ARs (technically, it's possible for an AR-15 to be a pistol if you classify it as such when you manufacture it, <em>and do not ever attach a buttstock</em>, but that's a whole other subject).\r\n\r\nGas system refers to the entire system that operates the rifle, starting at the gas port in the barrel, where gas that propels the round out of the chamber is siphoned off through the gas block (which is usually also the front sight in a standard AR configuration) and sent back toward the bolt carrier inside the upper receiver. The gas is fed into what's called the gas key on the bolt carrier (the thing on the top toward the front, an elevated tube with the opening toward the bolt) which allows the next steps in the cycle of operation (unlocking, extracting, ejecting, cocking) to take place.\r\n\r\n<em>1: Dwell time</em> is the amount of time the bullet stays in the barrel after it passes the gas port and begins sending gas back to operation the weapon."}

Ignoring some variations in bullet velocity with barrel length, we can think about dwell time in terms of how long the barrel forward of the gas port is.  The other major variable here is how much pressure there is at the gas port to apply force to the bolt.  The closer you are to the chamber, the greater the pressure, the further you are, the lower the pressure.\r\n\r\nEugene Stone designed the original M16 with a 20\" barrel and a gas port about 13\" from the chamber, giving 7\" of dwell time.  This is probably the best setup from a pure reliability standpoint, but it's a fairly long weapon, not the best for fighting inside buildings and the like.  \r\n\r\nDuring the Vietnam war, Colt went through several less than satisfactory designs for shorter versions of the M16 before settling on the Colt Commando (also known as the XM177 or the GAU-5/A).  It had a 11.5\" barrel with a gas port 7.5\" from the chamber.  Note that compared to the rifle this setup has the gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but this is offset by a shorter dwell time (that pressure is acting for a shorter period of time).  \r\n\r\nWhen Colt developed the M4 Carbine, they took the Commando and lengthened the barrel to 14.5 inches, while keeping the gas port 7.5 inches from the chamber.  This makes it possible to mount a bayonet on the carbine because the end of the barrel is the same distance from the gas block as it is on the rifle.  Comparing this to the M16, we have a gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but it now has the same 7 inches of dwell time as the rifle.  This makes the M4 somewhat overgassed compared to the rifle, but it still works fairly well.\r\n\r\nThe military's widespread adoption of the M4 created civilian demand for a look-alike.  However, the National Firearms Act says that a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16\" is a Short Barreled Rifle, requiring a bunch of paperwork and paying a $200 tax.  Thus most manufacturers of M4geries added another 1.5 inches to the barrel to meet the 16\" minimum.  Now we've got a 16\" barrel with a 7.5 inch gas system.  The gas port is closer to the chamber than on an M16 (higher pressure) and the dwell time is *longer*.  This creates a substantially overgassed rifle.  \r\n\r\nThis finally brings us to the midlength gas system.  Manufacturers recognized the issues with 16\" barrels and carbine length gas systems.  In response, they moved the gas port forward two inches (to 9.5\" from the chamber).  On a gun with a 16\" barrel, this produces a rifle with a gas port that's closer to the chamber than an M16 (but further than a carbine), and has a dwell time about on par with the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe carbine length gas system on a 16\" barrel is essentially an accident of history.  Now, this isn't to say that a 16\" with a carbine length gas system won't run, but it will shoot a bit harder and suffer a bit more wear and tear than a similar gun with the midlength gas system."}

So can someoneone more experienced share their thoughts on accuracy expectation at different distances? I think it can be very useful info for many beginners. \r\n\r\n-------\r\nEDIT\r\n\r\nTo clarify the question. I am looking for some meaningful reference point that can be used to set shooting training goals. Lets assume that we are talking about average mammal in good health and not too young or old who is willing to invest some time and effort into learning how to shoot.\r\n\r\nMore to the point. From my martial arts training experience, if new person asks 'when am I going to be a black belt?' that can't be answered as it's very specific to individual abilities and commitment. However, question 'On average, how long will it take for the regular person who is training reasonably hard to attain black belt level in this group?' is totally answerable. And the beginner can set the goal of reaching certain level and work toward that goal while measuring progress.\r\n\r\nFor shooting I just want a recommendation on how to quantify my progress and what my goal should be, for example, in a year.

This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.</strong> Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting. A 1:9 barrel will have trouble with loads much heavier than the mid-60gr range, which puts many very effective defense, long range, and hunting loads outside their ability to stabilize.\r\n\r\nSimply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. <strong>Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.</strong> To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.\r\n\r\n#Bullet stability and twist rate\r\nTwist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (\"one-in-seven\") twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability\">Greenhill Formula</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png\" alt=\"The Greenhill Formula\" />\r\n\r\n - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\r\n - D = bullet's diameter in inches\r\n - L = bullet's length in inches\r\n - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\r\n\r\nNote that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. <strong>The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.</strong> \r\n\r\nEarly AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior."}

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.</em>\r\n\r\nThere are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as \"Armory Clean\" or \"Inspection Clean\" every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia \u2014 \"that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it\" \u2014 keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.\r\n\r\nThe notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. <a href=\"http://www.eagtactical.com/\">EAG Tactical</a>, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as \"Filthy 14\". This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).\r\n\r\n#AR Cleaning Wisdom\r\nIt is important that you run the rods through the barrel rod-first, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through. This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. If you try to push them through patch-first, you'll bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and it'll be extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pulling with all their worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.\r\n\r\nWhen cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a> is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.\r\n\r\n#Functionally Clean\r\nThe level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle\r\n - Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests\r\n\r\nOptional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin out with firing pin\r\n\r\nWipe down all of these and reassemble. If carbon is heavily caked on the neck of the bolt, scrape off the big chunks (removing it all is not necessary).\r\n\r\n - Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel (not terribly important to function, but makes the charging handle pull nice and smooth which I like)\r\n - Remove the buffer spring and buffer from the buffer tube, wipe them down, and as much of the interior of the buffer as you can, then replace\r\n - Wipe down the interior of the lower receiver\r\n - Wipe down the exterior of the rifle\r\n\r\nReassemble, lube, and function check. \r\n\r\n#Armory or Inspection Clean\r\n - Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove<sup>1</sup>)\r\n - Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, and cam pin\r\n\r\nSame optional bit applies here about <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>. Make sure you scrape <em>all</em> of the carbon off the neck of the bolt.\r\n\r\n - Remove the extractor by pressing out the extractor retaining pin with the tip of the firing pin<sup>2</sup>\r\n\r\nClean the bolt face (where the locking lugs are and the firing pin protrudes) now that the extractor is out of the way. Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.\r\n\r\n - Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.\r\n\r\nClean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.\r\n\r\n - Remove the handguards if you can.\r\n - Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).\r\n\r\nUsing the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.\r\n\r\nUsing q-tips (the kind with a swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle) clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:\r\n\r\n - The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor<sup>3</sup>\r\n - The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)\r\n - The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)\r\n - The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in \u2014 looks like a star to some people)\r\n - The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake\r\n - Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver\r\n - The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver\r\n - Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates\r\n - The front wall of the chamber of the barrel\r\n\r\nIf you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.\r\n\r\nUsing your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. <strong>Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch</strong>. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch.

This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.\r\n\r\nThe notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. <a href=\"http://www.eagtactical.com/\">EAG Tactical</a>, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as \"Filthy 14\".

As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).\r\n\r\n#AR Cleaning Wisdom\r\nIt is important that you run the rods through the barrel rod-first, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through. This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. If you try to push them through patch-first, you'll bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and it'll be extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pulling with all their worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.\r\n\r\nWhen cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a> is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.\r\n\r\nYou will use q-tips to clean the rifle no matter how clean you want it. Functionally clean will require far fewer of them. Get the kind with a tightly wrapped swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle. The tighter the swab on the end, the less likely it is to rip off and leave pieces in impossible-to-reach places. It's also smaller and will fit better in places like the firing pin channel.\r\n\r\nYou must understand that getting a rifle \"Inspection Clean\" will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. \"Functionally Clean\" will cover most of them with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will \"bleed\" cleaner and filth and your rifle will be \"dirty\" again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay. You don't need to clean your rifle for three days in a row.\r\n\r\nBefore, during, and after cleaning is a great time to inspect your rifle for worn, damaged, or broken parts. It's also a great time to replace parts that need replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, and gas rings. Check your gas rings by setting the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight. If it doesn't, then bump the table, it should fall part way but not completely foreward. If it does, you need new gas rings.\r\n\r\n#Functionally Clean\r\nThe level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle\r\n - Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests\r\n\r\nOptional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin out with firing pin\r\n\r\nWipe down all of these parts. If carbon is heavily caked on the neck of the bolt, scrape it off (removing it all is not necessary, don't obsess over it). Clean the firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nWipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel (not terribly important to function, but makes the charging handle pull nice and smooth which I like). \r\n\r\nAt this point you can run a bore snake through your barrel, \r\n\r\n - Remove the buffer spring and buffer from the buffer tube, wipe them down, and as much of the interior of the buffer as you can, then replace\r\n - Wipe down the interior of the lower receiver\r\n - Wipe down the exterior of the rifle\r\n\r\nReassemble, lube, and function check. \r\n\r\n#Armory or Inspection Clean\r\n - Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove<sup>1</sup>)\r\n - Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, and cam pin\r\n\r\nSame optional bit applies here about <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>. Make sure you scrape <em>all</em> of the carbon off the neck of the bolt.\r\n\r\n - Remove the extractor by pressing out the extractor retaining pin with the tip of the firing pin<sup>2</sup>\r\n\r\nClean the bolt face (where the locking lugs are and the firing pin protrudes) now that the extractor is out of the way. Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.\r\n\r\n - Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.\r\n\r\nClean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.\r\n\r\n - Remove the handguards if you can.\r\n - Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).\r\n\r\nUsing the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.\r\n\r\nUsing q-tips clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:\r\n\r\n - The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor<sup>3</sup>\r\n - The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)\r\n - The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)\r\n - The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in \u2014 looks like a star to some people)\r\n - The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake\r\n - Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver\r\n - The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver\r\n - Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates\r\n - The front wall of the chamber of the barrel\r\n\r\nIf you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.\r\n\r\nUsing your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. <strong>Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch</strong>. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along.

If it does fall closed, you need new gas rings. <strong>You do not need all three gas rings for the gun to run. You do not need to make sure the gas ring gaps are not lined up. I've run thousands of rounds through an M4 on a range with 1 gas ring.</strong> But if you're missing gas rings, there's no reason you shouldn't replace them with a fresh set if you have the chance.\r\n\r\nThings I inspect:\r\n\r\n - Do both hammer spring legs mirror each other?\r\n - Is the hammer lose or does it not swing in a straight path?\r\n - Is the canted, or not parallel in the sides of the lower receiver? \r\n - Is the gas tube parallel with the charging handle channel in the upper receiver? \r\n - Does the carrier slide forward easily, and without noticeable movement of the gas tube?\r\n - Is there only one lug on one side of the extractor?\r\n - Is the firing pin retaining pin looking like its had better days?\r\n - Are my sights canted?\r\n\r\n<strong>Only use your barrel cleaning patches once.

You don't need to clean your rifle for three days in a row.\r\n\r\n#Inspecting Your Rifle's Serviceability\r\nBefore, during, and after cleaning is a great time to inspect your rifle for worn, damaged, or broken parts. It's also a great time to replace parts that need regular replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, firing pin retaining pin, and gas rings.\r\n\r\nTo check your gas rings, set the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight. If it does not fall closed, bump the table or whatever it's sitting on, and it should fall part way but not completely closed. If it does fall closed, you need new gas rings. <strong>You do not need all three gas rings for the gun to run. You do not need to make sure the gas ring gaps are not lined up. I've run thousands of rounds through an M4 on a range with 1 gas ring.</strong> But if you're missing gas rings, there's no reason you shouldn't replace them with a fresh set if you have the chance.\r\n\r\nThings I inspect:\r\n\r\n - Do both hammer spring legs mirror each other?\r\n - Is the hammer lose or does it not swing in a straight path?\r\n - Is the hammer canted, or not parallel to the sides of the lower receiver? \r\n - Is the gas tube parallel with the charging handle channel in the upper receiver? \r\n - Does the carrier slide forward easily, and without noticeable movement of the gas tube?\r\n - Is there only one lug on one side of the extractor?\r\n - Is the firing pin retaining pin looking like its had better days?\r\n - Are my sights canted?\r\n\r\n<strong>Only use your barrel cleaning patches once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't use toilet paper.</strong>\r\n\r\n#Functionally Clean\r\nThe level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle\r\n - Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests\r\n\r\nOptional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>.\r\n\r\n - Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin<sup>2</sup> out with firing pin\r\n\r\nWipe down all of these parts. If carbon is heavily caked on the neck of the bolt, scrape it off (removing it all is not necessary, don't obsess over it). Clean the firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nWipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel. \r\n\r\nAt this point you can run a bore snake through your barrel.\r\n\r\nUsing your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. <strong>Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch</strong>. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along. If they are not, repeat this process with one wet patch and dry-until-clean until you see the walls of the barrel shine.<sup>4</sup>\r\n\r\n<strong>Only use each patch once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't use toilet paper.</strong>\r\n\r\n - Remove the buffer spring and buffer from the buffer tube, wipe them down, and as much of the interior of the buffer as you can, then replace\r\n - Wipe down the interior of the lower receiver\r\n - Wipe down the exterior of the rifle\r\n\r\nReassemble, lube, and function check. \r\n\r\n#Armory or Inspection Clean\r\nThe only time I clean my personal rifles to this level is for long-term storage, or after a few thousand rounds and a few functional cleanings have accumulated. I try to get a couple hundred rounds per month through my rifle, so this is probably every six months or so. Long-term storage for me is very rare. \r\n\r\n - Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove<sup>1</sup>)\r\n - Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin<sup>2</sup>, and cam pin\r\n\r\nSame optional bit applies here about <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a>. Make sure you scrape <em>all</em> of the carbon off the neck of the bolt.\r\n\r\n - Remove the extractor by pressing out the extractor retaining pin with the tip of the firing pin<sup>2</sup>\r\n\r\nClean the bolt face (where the locking lugs are and the firing pin protrudes) now that the extractor is out of the way. Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.\r\n\r\n - Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.\r\n\r\nClean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.\r\n\r\n - Remove the handguards if you can.\r\n - Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).\r\n\r\nUsing the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.\r\n\r\nUsing q-tips clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:\r\n\r\n - The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor<sup>3</sup>\r\n - The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)\r\n - The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)\r\n - The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in \u2014 looks like a star to some people)\r\n - The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake\r\n - Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver\r\n - The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver\r\n - Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates\r\n - The front wall of the chamber of the barrel\r\n\r\nIf you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.\r\n\r\nUsing your cleaning rods, run the bore brush through a few times, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. <strong>Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch</strong>.

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.</em>\r\n\r\nThere are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as \"Armory Clean\" or \"Inspection Clean\" every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia \u2014 \"that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it\" \u2014 keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.\r\n\r\nThe notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. <a href=\"http://www.eagtactical.com/\">EAG Tactical</a>, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as \"Filthy 14\". This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).\r\n\r\n#AR Cleaning Wisdom\r\n<strong>It is important that you run cleaning rods through the barrel rod-first-patch-last, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through.</strong> This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. <strong>If you try to push them through patch-first, the patch turns back toward the rod and wraps it up, making it too big around to fit through the barrel.</strong> You <em>WILL</em> bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and make this job extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pushing with all they're worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.\r\n\r\nWhen cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, <a href=\"http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html\">Slip2000 Carbon Killer</a> is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.\r\n\r\nYou will use q-tips to clean the rifle no matter how clean you want it. Functionally clean will require far fewer of them. Get the kind with a tightly wrapped swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle. The tighter the swab on the end, the less likely it is to rip off and leave pieces in impossible-to-reach places. It's also smaller and will fit better in places like the firing pin channel.\r\n\r\nYou must understand that getting a rifle \"Inspection Clean\" will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. \"Functionally Clean\" will cover most of them with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will \"bleed\" cleaner and filth and your rifle will be \"dirty\" again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay.

For example, Michigan re-legalized the purchase of suppressors in September 2011 after having them disallowed back in 1977 (<a href=\"http://shekel.blogspot.com/2011/09/sound-of-silencers-can-now-return-to.html\">history</a>). Regarding machine guns, <strong>a transferable machine gun is one that was manufactured and registered before the closing of the registry on May 19th 1986</strong>. Any machine gun manufactured after that date can only be owned by law enforcement, government, or FFLs paying the SOT. If machine guns of modern manufacture are what you're after, see the section below titled \"I Want To Be A Dealer\" and evaluate the process.\r\n\r\nIf the type of NFA firearm or suppresser you want is allowed in your state, the next step is to decide if you're going to \"manufacture\" your firearm or suppressor (filling out a \"form 1\", or simply transfer it from the manufacturer to you (filling out a \"form 4\").\r\n\r\nThe two types of forms a person needs to know are:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf\">ATF F 5320.1 (Form 1) \u2014 Application to make and Register a Firearm</a>\r\n - <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf\">ATF F 5320.4 (Form 4) \u2014 Application For Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of Firearm</a>\r\n\r\nThese forms can be found \u2014 along with instructions for their use \u2014\u00a0at the <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/firearms/\">ATF Online Firearms Forms</a> page and the <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html\">ATF Online Firearms FAQ for the National Firearms Act</a>.\r\n\r\n##For transfer (to an individual, in my state):\r\nI want to buy a suppressor, or a rifle or shotgun that was registered as a short barrel version at the factory by the original manufacturer.\r\n\r\n - Purchase the firearm or suppressor\r\n - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos\r\n - When the firearm or suppressor arrives at your dealer, go to them and fill out ATF Form 4 \u2014\u00a0again in duplicate\r\n - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your \"CLEO\" or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your sheriff)\r\n - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury\r\n\r\nPut this whole package in the mail \u2014 all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 4s \u2014 and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back.\r\n\r\nWhen the package is returned to you with a copy of the approved forms and your attached stamp, take this paperwork into the dealer that's been holding your NFA firearm or suppressor for all these months. Most FFLs will charge you a rather large sum for transferring an NFA firearm or suppressor, which you will now pay and he'll hand over your merchandise.\r\n\r\n##For manufacture of a firearm (as an individual, in my state):\r\nI already have, or will soon have, a rifle or shotgun that I would like to convert to a short barrel version.\r\n\r\n - Purchase the firearm\r\n - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos\r\n - Fill out ATF Form 1 \u2014\u00a0again in duplicate\r\n - Engrave your name, city and state on the firearm's serialized part \u2014 you must use a permanent section of the serialized part (the trigger guard or buttstock of an AR-15 are not allowed)\r\n - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your \"CLEO\" or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your Sheriff)\r\n - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury\r\n\r\nPut this whole package in the mail \u2014 all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 1s \u2014 and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back. <strong>Once you have the paperwork returned, you are allowed to assemble or modify your weapon.</strong> You can purchase short-barreled uppers for AR-15s at any time, for example. Mounting that upper to a lower is illegal until the paperwork has been returned and your lower is engraved. Having a gunsmith modify the barrel length of your shotgun is illegal before the paperwork has been returned and the receiver is engraved.\r\n\r\n##Variables\r\nTimelines for this fluctuate constantly. When I purchased two SBRs on a Form 4 back in 2006, the ATF took just over 2 months to return my paperwork to me. Current reported wait times as of early November 2011 are as high as 6 months. Some people report that a trust or corp makes their process go faster, others have experienced the opposite.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, <strong>there are a lot of variables in this process, state by state and for special situations</strong>. State to state, laws allowing certain types of NFA weapons and suppressors can be different. Different people in the Sheriff's seat can choose to not sign off on your Form 4 or Form 1. They can also choose to simply not sign <em>any</em> NFA paperworkat all. This leads us to yet another variable: trusts and incorporation.\r\n\r\nA trust or a corporation (S corp, C corp, LLC, etc.) can own NFA firearms and suppressors. This can either be a true company such as a gun store (see the section below titled \"I Want To Be A Dealer\"), or it can be an corporation or trust acting on behalf of an individual (you). The biggest advantages to doing a trust or corporation are:\r\n\r\n - Reduction in paperwork\r\n  - Trusts and corporations can not have fingerprints or passport photos, so these are not required\r\n  - Trusts and corporations do not require a Sheriff's signature on the Form 1 or Form 4 (this is how you get around a grumpy, no-signature Sheriff)\r\n - Flexibility with the handling of NFA firearms after your death\r\n - Any trustee or member can possess and use the firearm or suppressor, rather than only the individual listed on the Form 1 or 4\r\n - Removals of many liabilities from the individual\r\n\r\nThere are many more intricacies and benefits to a corporation or trust. Trusts are preferred to corporations generally because corporations have ongoing fees associated.\r\n\r\n<strong>The best advice I can give you about trusts is to talk to a lawyer who has set up NFA Trusts.</strong> There can be differences between the setup of a trust for NFA items and a trust for normal assets. A lot of law firms and estate planning firms will have experience here, and again things can vary state-to-state. <a href=\"http://www.ncestateplanningblog.com/2009/11/articles/estate-planning/trusts/nfa-gun-trusts-provide-many-advantages/\">Here</a> is a good write-up about the advantages of using a trust for NFA items. \r\n\r\n#I Want To Become A Dealer\r\n\r\nTo be a dealer you must obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). An FFL alone will not let you purchase or manufacture NFA weapons. First you must obtain the right FFL, or combination of FFLs, from the many different types, to be eligible to obtain status as a special operations taxes payer. You must obtain status as a special operations taxes payer for the additional privileges of dealing with NFA weapons.\r\n\r\n##Federal Firearms Licenses\r\n\r\nThe ATF considers you a \"dealer\" if you make more than a certain level of your income from firearms. This includes gunsmiths and ammunition makers as you will see:\r\n\r\n - Type 1 FFL is a Title 1 dealer or gunsmith\r\n - Type 2 FFL is a Title 1 dealer doing business as a pawnbroker\r\n - Type 3 FFL is a licensed collector of Curio & Relic (C&R) firearms\r\n - Type 6 FFL is a licensed maker of ammunition and reloading components other than armor piercing ammunition<sup>1</sup>\r\n - Type 7 FFL is a Title 1 manufacturer of firearms, ammunition and ammunition components other than NFA,  Destructive Devices and Armor Piercing ammunition\r\n - Type 8 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms and ammunition\r\n - Type 9 FFL is a dealer in Title 1 firearms including NFA destructive devices, but no other NFA\r\n - Type 10 FFL is a manufacturer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and ammunition components, including NFA Destructive Devices but no other NFA, and not including Armor Piercing ammunition\r\n - Type 11 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and NFA Destructive Devices, but no other NFA\r\n\r\n##Special Operations Taxes\r\n\r\nNFA firearms are one of these supplemental privileges.  These supplemental taxes are referred to as \"Special Operations Taxes\" (or just \"SOT\") and as with all things, there are different types:\r\n\r\n - A <strong>Class 3 SOT dealer</strong> is a dealer of NFA firearms\r\n - A <strong>Class 2 SOT manufacturer</strong> is a manufacturer of NFA firearms\r\n - A <strong>Class 1 SOT importer</strong> is an importer of NFA firearms \r\n\r\nRemember that these are in addition to the tax payer being a licensed dealer (holder of a FFL) already.\r\n\r\n<strong>To be eligible for Class 3 SOT status, you need a dealer or manufacturer FFL: Type 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $500, due on July 1st.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for Class 2 SOT status, you need a manufacturer FFL: Types 7 or 10. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for Class 1 SOT status, you need an importer FFL: Types 8 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.\r\n\r\nReduced tax rates are for small importers and manufacturers. All additional taxes are due on July 1st of each year.\r\n\r\n"}

Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy?\r\n 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.\r\n 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)\r\n 4. <strong>FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.</STRONG>\r\n 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)\r\n 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life <a href=\"\">run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions</a> through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).\r\n\r\nI can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've <em>shot the gun</em>.\r\n\r\nA quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith & Wesson's M&P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler & Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.</strong>"}

The Glock 21, XD .45, the fullsize HK USP and Mark 23, and Para Ordinance double-stack pistols all fit this category.  \r\n\r\nBe aware that there are some 'double stack' .45s that are more like stack-and-a-half, rather than true double stacks.  The narrower magazines are intended to make it easier for people with average hands to grip them, but it kind of undermines those of us with large hands.  These include the M&P .45, the HK USP Compact and HK45.  Basically any fullsize .45 with a mag capacity of 10 rounds or less probably has a narrower than true double-stack magazine.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I've got fairly big mitts and find that the Glock 21 fits me like a glove.

For example, Michigan re-legalized the purchase of suppressors in September 2011 after having them disallowed back in 1977 (<a href=\"http://shekel.blogspot.com/2011/09/sound-of-silencers-can-now-return-to.html\">history</a>). Regarding machine guns, <strong>a transferable machine gun is one that was manufactured and registered prior to the closing of the registry on May 19th, 1986</strong>. Any machine gun manufactured after that date can only be owned by law enforcement, government, or FFLs paying the SOT. If machine guns of modern manufacture are what you're after, see the section below titled \"I Want To Be A Dealer\" and evaluate the process.\r\n\r\nIf the type of NFA firearm or suppresser you want is allowed in your state, the next step is to decide if you're going to \"manufacture\" \u2014 usually more accurately described as \"convert\" \u2014 your existing firearm (filling out a \"form 1\"), or simply transfer it as an existing NFA firearm or suppressor from the manufacturer to you (filling out a \"form 4\").\r\n\r\nThe two types of forms a person needs to know are:\r\n\r\n - <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf\">ATF F 5320.1 (Form 1) \u2014 Application to make and Register a Firearm</a>\r\n - <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf\">ATF F 5320.4 (Form 4) \u2014 Application For Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of Firearm</a>\r\n\r\nThese forms can be found \u2014 along with instructions for their use \u2014\u00a0at the <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/firearms/\">ATF Online Firearms Forms</a> page and the <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html\">ATF Online Firearms FAQ for the National Firearms Act</a> page.\r\n\r\n##For transfer (to an individual, in my state):\r\nI want to buy a suppressor, or a rifle or shotgun that was registered as a short barrel version at the factory by the original manufacturer.\r\n\r\n - Purchase the firearm or suppressor\r\n - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos\r\n - When the firearm or suppressor arrives at your dealer, go to them and fill out ATF Form 4 \u2014\u00a0again in duplicate\r\n - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your \"CLEO\" or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your sheriff)\r\n - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury\r\n\r\nPut this whole package in the mail \u2014 all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 4s \u2014 and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back.\r\n\r\nWhen the package is returned to you with a copy of the approved forms and your attached stamp, take this paperwork into the dealer that's been holding your NFA firearm or suppressor for all these months. Most FFLs will charge you a rather large sum for transferring an NFA firearm or suppressor, which you will now pay and he'll hand over your merchandise.\r\n\r\n##For manufacture of a firearm (as an individual, in my state):\r\nI already have, or will soon have, a rifle or shotgun that I would like to convert to a short barrel version.\r\n\r\n - Purchase the firearm\r\n - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos\r\n - Fill out ATF Form 1 \u2014\u00a0again in duplicate\r\n - Engrave your name, city and state on the firearm's serialized part \u2014 you must use a permanent section of the serialized part (the trigger guard or buttstock of an AR-15 are not allowed)\r\n - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your \"CLEO\" or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your Sheriff)\r\n - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury\r\n\r\nPut this whole package in the mail \u2014 all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 1s \u2014 and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back. <strong>Once you have the paperwork returned, you are allowed to assemble or modify your weapon.</strong> You can purchase short-barreled uppers for AR-15s at any time, for example. Mounting that upper to a lower is illegal until the paperwork has been returned and your lower is engraved. Having a gunsmith modify the barrel length of your shotgun is illegal before the paperwork has been returned and the receiver is engraved.\r\n\r\n##Variables\r\nTimelines for this fluctuate constantly. When I purchased two SBRs on a Form 4 back in 2006, the ATF took just over 2 months to return my paperwork to me. Current reported wait times as of early November 2011 are as high as 6 months. Some people report that a trust or corp makes their process go faster, others have experienced the opposite.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, <strong>there are a lot of variables in this process, state by state and for special situations</strong>. State to state, laws allowing certain types of NFA weapons and suppressors can be different. Different people in the Sheriff's seat can choose to not sign off on your Form 4 or Form 1. They can also choose to simply not sign <em>any</em> NFA paperworkat all. This leads us to yet another variable: trusts and incorporation.\r\n\r\nA trust or a corporation (S corp, C corp, LLC, etc.) can own NFA firearms and suppressors. This can either be a true company such as a gun store (see the section below titled \"I Want To Be A Dealer\"), or it can be a corporation or trust acting on behalf of an individual (you, your estate) or group (your family). The biggest advantages (to me) in doing a trust or corporation are:\r\n\r\n - Reduction in paperwork\r\n  - Trusts and corporations can not have fingerprints or passport photos, so these are not required\r\n  - Trusts and corporations do not require a Sheriff's signature on the Form 1 or Form 4 (this is how you get around a grumpy, no-signature Sheriff)\r\n - Flexibility with the handling of NFA firearms after your death\r\n - Any trustee or member can possess and use the firearm or suppressor, rather than only the individual listed on the Form 1 or 4\r\n - Removals of many liabilities from the individual\r\n\r\nThere are many more intricacies and benefits to a corporation or trust. Trusts are preferred to corporations generally because corporations have ongoing fees associated.\r\n\r\n<strong>The best advice I can give you about trusts is to talk to a lawyer who has set up NFA Trusts.</strong> There can be differences between the setup of a trust for NFA items and a trust for normal assets. A lot of law firms and estate planning firms will have experience here, and again things can vary state-to-state. <a href=\"http://www.ncestateplanningblog.com/2009/11/articles/estate-planning/trusts/nfa-gun-trusts-provide-many-advantages/\">Here</a> is a good write-up about the advantages of using a trust for NFA items. Lawyers from some states may or may not be able to practice in your state, so this may only be good for reference. Maybe the author can practice in your state as well as his or you live in the same state, in which case he can help you. Again, you'll have to do your homework.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n#I Want To Become A Dealer\r\n\r\nTo be a dealer you must obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). An FFL alone will not let you purchase or manufacture NFA weapons. First you must obtain the right FFL, or combination of FFLs, from the many different types, to be eligible to obtain status as a special operations taxes payer. You must obtain status as a special operations taxes payer for the additional privileges of dealing with NFA weapons.\r\n\r\n##Federal Firearms Licenses\r\n\r\nThe ATF considers you a \"dealer\" if you make more than a certain level of your income from firearms. This includes gunsmiths and ammunition makers as you will see:\r\n\r\n - Type 1 FFL is a Title 1 dealer or gunsmith\r\n - Type 2 FFL is a Title 1 dealer doing business as a pawnbroker\r\n - Type 3 FFL is a licensed collector of Curio & Relic (C&R) firearms\r\n - Type 6 FFL is a licensed maker of ammunition and reloading components other than armor piercing ammunition<sup>1</sup>\r\n - Type 7 FFL is a Title 1 manufacturer of firearms, ammunition and ammunition components other than NFA,  Destructive Devices and Armor Piercing ammunition\r\n - Type 8 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms and ammunition\r\n - Type 9 FFL is a dealer in Title 1 firearms including NFA destructive devices, but no other NFA\r\n - Type 10 FFL is a manufacturer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and ammunition components, including NFA Destructive Devices but no other NFA, and not including Armor Piercing ammunition\r\n - Type 11 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and NFA Destructive Devices, but no other NFA\r\n\r\n##Special Operations Taxes\r\n\r\nNFA firearms are one of these supplemental privileges.  These supplemental taxes are referred to as \"Special Operations Taxes\" (or just \"SOT\") and as with all things, there are different types:\r\n\r\n - A <strong>Class 3 SOT dealer</strong> is a dealer of NFA firearms\r\n - A <strong>Class 2 SOT manufacturer</strong> is a manufacturer of NFA firearms\r\n - A <strong>Class 1 SOT importer</strong> is an importer of NFA firearms \r\n\r\nRemember that these are in addition to the tax payer being a licensed dealer (holder of a FFL) already.\r\n\r\n<strong>To be eligible for Class 3 SOT status, you need a dealer or manufacturer FFL: Type 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $500.</strong>\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for Class 2 SOT status, you need a manufacturer FFL: Types 7 or 10. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for Class 1 SOT status, you need an importer FFL: Types 8 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.\r\n\r\nReduced tax rates are for small importers and manufacturers. All additional taxes are due on July 1st of each year.\r\n\r\n"}

But, what type of self defense? Home? In public? While these two examples are similar, they create different requirements. If you want to carry a concealed weapon for self defense in public, you will likely choose a smaller form factor. Home defense may warrant a larger handgun. Furthermore, who or what are you defending against? Human targets or wildlife? For example, having a revolver loaded with snake shot is great on the ranch in Arizona (the U.S. state with the most rattlesnakes), but I wouldn't choose it in a gunfight.\r\n\r\nOnce you really know the purpose of a weapon, it will be clearer what weapon you need, what ammunition works best, what training you'll seek, and what special considerations come into play (like a concealed carry permit)."}

If you handload, use known-good match bullets, or if you need to use hunting bullets use one of the hunting bullets that has a reputation for accuracy.  If you don't handload, try to choose factory ammo that uses a high quality bullet.  For what it's worth I have found that Nosler Ballistic Tip bullets are nearly as accurate as match bullets (and they are sometimes available in factory ammo too).\r\n\r\nThere's a pretty good chance that your rifle's bedding is decent enough as-is.  One thing worth doing is to take the rifle out of the stock and ensure that the receiver and the interior are not oil soaked (e.g. from cleaning solvent).  If it is, wipe it clean and dry.  Assemble your action into your stock and tighten the screws to a uniform \"very snug\" level.  You don't want to damage the screw heads or overstress the screws, but you do want it good and snug.\r\n\r\nCleaning your barrel from time to time can help.\r\n\r\nIf you're not already a well-practiced shooter.... well, practice shooting!  Firing groups from support off of a bench might be easier that shooting offhand, but it is still very hard to get really superb results.  Practice at it and your shooting will improve.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a particularly light trigger to shoot a rifle accurately.  Having a really clean and crisp trigger can make it much easier to shoot well.  Fortunately your trigger as it came from the factory is probably pretty darn good.  If not, have it adjusted so that it is clean and crisp.\r\n"}

For a right handed shooter, \"too much finger\" can cause the gun to pull to the right and \"not enough finger\" can push the gun to the left.\r\n\r\n#Purchasing A Pistol\r\n\r\nI generally give these pieces of advice when purchasing a pistol (to be done in this order):\r\n\r\n 1. Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy?\r\n 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.\r\n 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)\r\n 4. <strong>FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.</STRONG>\r\n 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)\r\n 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life <a href=\"\">run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions</a> through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).\r\n\r\nI can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've <em>shot the gun</em>.\r\n\r\nA quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith & Wesson's M&P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler & Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.</strong>"}

This will truly give you no idea about when the round will fire and let you focus on keeping everything else in line.\r\n\r\nThe previously mentioned fundamentals you should be focusing on:\r\n\r\n - finger placement on the trigger\r\n - proper trigger press\r\n - good grip\r\n - proper sight picture/alignment\r\n - visual focus on thefront sight rather than the target\r\n - control of breathing\r\n\r\nFinger placement on the trigger was covered in another question here: <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/q/184/32\">Rounds are going low and left. What am I doing wrong?</a>. For a right handed shooter, \"too much finger\" can cause the gun to pull to the right and \"not enough finger\" can push the gun to the left. The answers on that question do an exceptional job of explaining the issue.\r\n\r\n#Purchasing A Pistol\r\n\r\nI generally give these pieces of advice when purchasing a pistol (to be done in this order):\r\n\r\n 1. Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy? (In your case, either learning with a .22 or learning and self defense with a standard handgun and .22 conversion.)\r\n 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.\r\n 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)\r\n 4. <strong>FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.</STRONG>\r\n 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)\r\n 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142\">run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions</a> through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).\r\n\r\nI can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've <em>shot the gun</em>.\r\n\r\nA quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith & Wesson's M&P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler & Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.</strong>"}

If you're looking to just become more comfortable with your home defense gun, I would recommend playing clay sports with as little as possible changed. I've shot trap and sporting clays with an 18.5\" iron-sighted barrel and did just fine. Some clubs don't allow barrels shorter than a certain length (often 22\") so having the longer barrel is handy. But, if you're looking for practice with your home defense gun, change as little as possible. Folks at the club may chuckle at your tactical gun, ignore them and have fun."}

There are a few very popular choices here, the downright most popular in my experience being the <a href=\"http://www.ruger.com/products/markIII/index.html\">Ruger Mark III</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ruger.com/products/2245/index.html\">Ruger 22/45</a> models.\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage to a .22 pistol is the lack of noise, muzzle blast, and recoil, and dirt-cheap ammo. This will give you the ability to practice without developing bad habits and to practice a lot for very little money. If you don't want to purchase one gun now and another gun later, you can purchase a pistol in a self defense caliber that has an available .22 LR conversion kit. This will allow you to practice your fundamentals of pistol marksmanship with the gun layout and controls you'll be using in a self defense situation.\r\n\r\n#The Fundamentals\r\n##(And How You Can Relearn Them If You're Broken)\r\n\r\n<strong>A strong foundation in the fundamentals of pistol marksmanship is the most important asset you can give yourself. The weight and caliber of the weapon will not have an appreciable affect accuracy if you have these fundamentals.</strong> What weight and caliber will affect is felt recoil, which can have effects on your accuracy through things like anticipation of recoil, grip, and trigger use.\r\n\r\nI know from personal experience how bad anticipation can be. When I first started shooting handguns, my cousin gave me a 1911 in .45 ACP. I didn't know anything about anything at the time, and for years I had to fight the natural urge to dip the barrel down in order to compensate for the muzzle flip post-firing.\r\n\r\nCompensation of this kind will lead to heartache. You can not, and must not try to, compensate for the recoil of a handgun. \r\n\r\nThe tricks that I have used to get over this are three-fold. \r\n\r\n 1. Shoot the heck out of a .22 LR handgun. Get a .22LR conversion for\r\n    your handgun of choice and shoot A LOT. The point of using the .22 is to\r\n    allow you to get used to the function of the gun without the worry\r\n    of recoil.<br /><strong>Focus on the\r\n    fundamentals is vital here.</strong>\r\n 2. Dry fire practice. Dry fire practice is essential for learning\r\n    trigger control. Make sure you dry fire with your centerfire\r\n    slide if you are using a conversion, not your rimfire slide.\r\n    <br /><strong>Rimfire guns should not be dry fired.</strong>\r\n    <br /><strong>Focus on the fundamentals is vital\r\n    here.</strong>\r\n 3. When firing your gun in its normal caliber, pull the trigger\r\n    extremely slowly. Focus on your control of the weapon but do not focus on the trigger\r\n    break. Let the round firing \"surprise\" you, and assess your\r\n    accuracy.<br /><strong>Focus on the fundamentals is vital\r\n    here.</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can also have a friend put their finger into the trigger guard from beside you and, with your finger on the trigger, have him press your finger rearward while you focus on all the previously mentioned fundamentals. This will truly give you no idea about when the round will fire and let you focus on keeping everything else in line.\r\n\r\nThe previously mentioned fundamentals you should be focusing on:\r\n\r\n - finger placement on the trigger\r\n - proper trigger press\r\n - good grip\r\n - proper sight picture/alignment\r\n - visual focus on thefront sight rather than the target\r\n - control of breathing\r\n\r\nFinger placement on the trigger was covered in another question here: <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/q/184/32\">Rounds are going low and left. What am I doing wrong?</a>. For a right handed shooter, \"too much finger\" can cause the gun to pull to the right and \"not enough finger\" can push the gun to the left. The answers on that question do an exceptional job of explaining the issue.\r\n\r\n#Purchasing A Pistol\r\n\r\nI generally give these pieces of advice when purchasing a pistol (to be done in this order):\r\n\r\n 1. Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy? (In your case, either learning with a .22 or learning and self defense with a standard handgun and .22 conversion.)\r\n 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.\r\n 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)\r\n 4. <strong>FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.</STRONG>\r\n 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)\r\n 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142\">run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions</a> through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).\r\n\r\nI can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've <em>shot the gun</em>.\r\n\r\nA quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith & Wesson's M&P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler & Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.</strong>\r\n\r\n#Training\r\nThe next step you can take is to find a local training company with a good reputation. Ask around at the range when you see people who seem to know what they're doing. Ask a cop if you happen to run into one walking around the mall. Ask any of your friends or acquaintances that are gun enthusiasts. Generally with training, as with guns and ammo, you'll get what you pay for. There are also large companies that travel all around the United States offering training classes in different areas. If one of these may be in your area or close enough for you to drive to, you can take a class with them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, taking the classes for a concealed carry permit (even if it's unlikely that you will be issued one) is a good place to get a basic grasp on the laws surrounding self defense and deadly force. I recommend caution here, as many instructors I've dealt with love to include opinion and preference right along with their presentation of the course. Looking up your local laws directly and speaking with other people at local training courses is great for this. A caveat to traveling trainers is they are unlikely to be as intimately familiar with your local laws (however many states share similar basics)."}

You can not, and\r\n> must not try to, compensate for the recoil of a handgun.\r\n\r\nFor more detail on your first handgun and considerations regarding it, please see <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/387/newbie-how-to-start-with-handguns/396#396\">that question</a>.\r\n\r\nAssuming you are set on a 1911 platform, <a href=\"http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/397/how-out-of-the-box-reliable-usable-are-1911s-what-work-needs-to-be-done-on-th/404#404\">kbyrd's answer</a> provides great information regarding non-duty models.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a 1911 for duty use (<strong>in my opinion, duty use includes concealed carry and home defense</strong>) you need to be committed to the platform. I can find no better reference for selecting a qualified duty 1911 than Hilton Yam's article at 10-8 Performance titled <a href=\"http://www.10-8performance.com/pages/Choosing-a-1911-for-Duty-Use.html\">Choosing a 1911 for Duty Use</a>. \r\n\r\nA quick example of the first part of his opinion about using the 1911 for duty:\r\n\r\n> First off, if you are truly serious about running a 1911, it needs to\r\n> be a full sized 5\" gun in .45 ACP. There certainly are any number of\r\n> examples of Commander and other compact 1911s that work or can be made\r\n> to work just fine, and for CCW use they can be a viable option for\r\n> some users. However, take a look at the history of unit issue service\r\n> 1911s - LAPD SWAT, USSOCOM, USMC Det-1, USMC MEUSOC, FBI HRT, FBI\r\n> SWAT, and let's not forget over 95 years with all the branches of the\r\n> U.S. military - and you won't find ANY major units that use anything\r\n> other than the original full sized gun. Why? After you field 50 or 350\r\n> guns at once and run thousands or even tens of thousands of rounds\r\n> through them during training cycles, you'll figure it out. \r\n> \r\n> By virtue\r\n> of their design, the shorter format 1911s reduce the window of\r\n> functional opportunity for the magazine and slide to work together to\r\n> feed, chamber, extract, and eject. This is an incontrovertible fact of\r\n> life. Proper weapon setup, spring rates, and magazine maintenance are\r\n> critical in running the shorter guns. Keeping after a few 1911s as a\r\n> single hobbyist or aficionado is different than running a bunch of\r\n> guns for a large unit. Remember that weapon down time equates to lost\r\n> training and operational time. You want to minimize your maintenance\r\n> issues, not increase them. Lastly, a full sized 1911 is very arguably\r\n> a more efficient shooting and ballistic delivery platform than a\r\n> smaller sized variant for the majority of users.\r\n\r\nOne subject which we disagree on is that a Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW) gun is not a duty gun. However, his argument is that a CCW gun can be the center of your attention, that you can dedicate the time and effort required to get it running right and keep it that way. This is time and effort a unit-level armorer can not spend on individual guns when he has to take care of a huge number of them, and in your case your requirement is also that you don't want to spend a lot of time and money getting your gun in working condition.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, CCW and duty guns both must be reliable out of the box and have a minimum of required modification and/or upkeep to be reliable."}

Also, in most cases, upgrading your sights will require either a gunsmith or some specialized tools and know-how.\r\n\r\n2. A decent barrel. There's somewhat of a lowest-common-denominator effect here in that a lot of barrels are more accurate than a lot of shooters, but upgrading your barrel properly requires some gunsmith work.\r\n\r\n3. Safety. This is something that isn't terribly hard in most cases to upgrade, but a secure, easy-to-manipulate safety is extremely important.\r\n\r\n4. Trigger. Try the trigger on any gun before you buy it. A smooth, reliable trigger is key to safety and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBeyond these, things like match-grade components are more than most shooters need. If you yourself are a proficient, match-grade shooter then you'll probably want to think about them, but otherwise you can save the money.\r\n\r\nAs far as 1911s that meet these criteria, the entry level Taurus 1911s have quite good sights, a good (ambidextrous) safety, and reasonable smooth but crisp triggers.

Being such a simple rifle, what you need to look for is rather easy to do. After you ensure that the rifle is unloaded and pointed in a safe direction:\r\n\r\n - Check the serial numbers on the bolt handle, bolt, receiver, and/or barrel to make sure they match. A Mosin might not have all of these serial numbers on these parts, but any numbers it does have on these specific parts should match to ensure proper head-spacing.\r\n - Rotate the bolt handle up and pull it fully rearward, pull the trigger and remove the bolt. Check the barrel for a good shine and note that the reflected light is straight. By this I mean if you look directly down the barrel the reflected light should form an equilateral triangle. As you rotate the barrel, the sides of the the \"triangle\" should be straight, any curving indicates the barrel is bent  (the more pronounced the curve, the more severe the bend).\r\n - If you are buying a \"new\" Mosin, directly from a dealer, then it may have cosmoline in the barrel and possibly some soaked into the stock. So don't reject a rifle if the barrel looks a little dirty, but note that the cosmoline may be hiding rust or bulges. However, if buying a used Mosin, it should have been cleaned and no cosmoline should remain.\r\n - On the whole this next point is not a big issue, but to some it matters. Repair of the crown, or counter-boring, is done to a rifle that has received some sort of damage on the muzzle end of the rifle's barrel and is detectable by running your finger around for about an inch inside the muzzle and not feeling any rifling. You may lose a small amount of velocity and accuracy, but it is rather inconsequential. If you prefer a rifle which has not been damaged enough to require repair, then look keep looking, there are plenty out there.\r\n\r\nFor tons more info check out [7.62x54r.net][1] (general info), and these forum threads: [this one from calguns.net][2], www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-482070.html , and www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-385289.html (what to look for when buying).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://7.62x54r.net/\r\n  [2]: http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?p=6450730"}

If the bullet is lose or you can see a gap between the edge of the casing and the side of the bullet, toss it.\r\n\r\nIn the AR15 platform, the floating firing pin inside the bolt will repeatedly strike the primer of the round. 5.56mm ammunition uses hard primers so that the light strikes from the firing pin do not cause problems. \r\n\r\nThe problems arises when the primer is lightly struck repeatedly. The primers will be more and more prone to failure with each strike, even after a very small number of chamberings. A large california SWAT department had two documented issues with this, one a misfire during a raid and one when they went to the range to fire the rest of their ammunition in an attempt to diagnose the problem. Others have had issues as well and I have seen similar things on ranges in the military.\r\n\r\n> However, despite what appeared to be good primer strikes, two problems\r\n> were discovered. First, when accurately measured, some of the primer\r\n> strikes had insufficient firing pin indentations. The failed round\r\n> from the potential OIS incident had a primer strike of only .013\"\u2014the\r\n> minimum firing pin indent for ignition is .017\".

And I say this as a guy who has is always wanting more magnification in his rifle scopes.\r\n\r\nFor spotting scopes, **somewhere between 20X and 25X** is what is most commonly used for 1000 yards shooting.  I would suggest that you use something similar for 100 yard shooting.\r\n\r\nThe ability to resolve detail (be that bullet holes, mirage etc) is much more dependent on the **clarity/sharpness of the the image** than the magnification used.  That is why seemingly-modest magnifications are used even for 1000 yard shooting; the difference between a $1000-$2000 25X scope and a $200 25X scope is not the magnification, it is mostly image sharpness (and to a certain extent waterproofedness).\r\n\r\nMany low end scopes are variable magnification, with top end magnifications of 60X or 80X.  In my experience the high end magnification of these scopes simply makes the field of view smaller and the image bigger and cloudier - it does not improve your ability to resolve small details.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with variable magnification and I wouldn't avoid buying a scope because it is a variable, but I also would not consider having variable magnification to be a feature worth paying for at all.\r\n\r\nBird watchers and photographers are bigger users of spotting scopes than shooters.  Many features important to them such as colour trueness, fringing, low-light performance etc, aren't actually very important to shooters (in my opinion).  One can optimize a scope selection for shooting performance differently than birders or photographers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to magnification there are some other considerations.  **Eye relief** is one of the most important (this means how close your eyeball has to be to the eyepiece in order to see the image).  Most low-cost scopes require that your eye be so close as to be nearly touching the eyepiece.  Not only is this impossible to use if you wear glasses, even if you don't wear glasses it is very inconvenient.  You will find it much easier to use a scope that allows for an inch or even more of eye relied.\r\n\r\nSome scopes are \"straight through\" (like a rifle scope), others have the eyepiece at a 45 degree angle.  In most shooting positions it requires less shifting from a shooting position to look through a 45 degree eyepiece.\r\n\r\n"}

Say a shooter is steady enough aiming and trigger control to break our shots within (say) a 3\" circle at 100 yards.  Obviously if he is aiming at a target at 20 yards he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 1/5th the size (since 20 yards is 5 times closer than 100 yards).  And if he is aiming at a target 300 yards away, he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 3 times as large (because 300 yards is 3 times as far as 100 yards).  But in all cases, he is breaking his shots inside a 3 MOA circle, which is why it is much more convenient to describe the accuracy of a shooter in terms of MOA rather than in inches (because \"inches\" alone isn't enough, it always has to be paired with the distance too).\r\n\r\nNow as why MOA and why not other angular units (such as mils, or decimal degrees)?  A few reasons:\r\n\r\n- when measuring distances in yards and bullet locations in inches, an MOA is so close to being \"an inch per hundred yards\" that it is too convenient to ignore\r\n\r\n- some rifles are more accurate that one MOA and some are less, but one MOA is a pretty conveniently-sized measuring stick for rifle accuracy.  One MOA is pretty darn good for a factory rifle; 2-3 MOA is acceptable accuracy for most factory rifles; just about any half-shot-out rifle ought to be able to deliver 5 MOA; a half-MOA rifle is really quite something; a quarter-MOA rifle is a level that most competitive target rifles don't achieve.\r\n\r\n- also, one MOA is a usefully-sized measuring stick for shooter accuracy too (when firing prone with iron sights shooting jacket and sling, an intermediate-level shooter will put the vast majority of his shots into a 2-MOA circle; best-in-the-world level shooters can put ten out of ten shots into a 1-MOA circle but this is hard enough that they will savour it!)\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth the next most common angular measurement you will find is the \"mil\", which is one part per thousand (the mil is bigger than the MOA, in rough terms a mil is about three MOA).\r\n\r\n- if you're measuring your range in metres and your offsets in centimetres, one mil is ten centimetres at 100 metres.  Since a mil is pretty coarse most scopes with mil adjustments have clicks every 0.1 mils, so one 0.1-mil \"click\" is \"one centimetre at 100m\".  Many European hunting scope have adjustment clicks labelled \"1cm at 100m\".\r\n"}

It is an enthusiasts gun. I really love the 1911-style, especially the trigger, but I also like working on them. You'll find that when most people say \"self defense\", the get really serious about reliability. While 1911's can be really great handguns if you're familiar with them, they can be fussy for someone new to the platform and especially new to guns in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this is just for fun, buy a new full-sized 1911-pattern gun from any major manufacturer. It should just work, if not send it in for warranty service. Don't go spend a several thousand dollars for a high end gun, get a production gun from Sig, S&W, Colt, Kimber, Springfield or others.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would consider before purchase is whether you want a beavertail grip safety or not. Some people get \"bit\" by the hammer on the web of their hand. If you think you want a GI-style 1911, with the original grip safety, I recommend shooting a hundred rounds or so at the range. You'll know pretty quickly whether it works for you or whether you want a beavertail."}

A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small \"heat shield\" has gone missing!\r\n\r\n* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.\r\n\r\n* Look at the cylinder's \"star\" at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.\r\n\r\n* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.\r\n\r\nWith the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is \"full lockup\" - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:\r\n\r\n* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.\r\n\r\n* Check for \"rotational wiggle\".  A little is OK on S&Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.\r\n\r\n* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  **UNLOAD** it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a \"circle behind a circle\"\r\neffect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the \"loose rotational lockup\" guns (S&W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's\r\npossible to \"nudge\" the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.\r\n\r\n* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is\r\nminimal, .003\" to .004\" optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006\" I'd be\r\nunhappy with it.\r\n\r\n* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's\r\nnext \"click\".\r\n\r\n* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  \r\n\r\n* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer\r\nbar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.\r\n\r\n* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger \"transfer bar pinch\" issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc."}

Being such a simple rifle, what you need to look for is rather easy to do. After you ensure that the rifle is unloaded and pointed in a safe direction:\r\n\r\n - Check the serial numbers on the bolt handle, bolt, receiver, and/or barrel to make sure they match. A Mosin might not have all of these serial numbers on these parts, but any numbers it does have on these specific parts should match to ensure proper head-spacing.\r\n - Rotate the bolt handle up and pull it fully rearward, pull the trigger and remove the bolt. Check the barrel for a good shine and note that the reflected light is straight. By this I mean if you look directly down the barrel the reflected light should form an equilateral triangle. As you rotate the barrel, the sides of the the \"triangle\" should be straight, any curving indicates the barrel is bent  (the more pronounced the curve, the more severe the bend).\r\n - If you are buying a \"new\" Mosin, directly from a dealer, then it may have cosmoline in the barrel and possibly some soaked into the stock. So don't reject a rifle if the barrel looks a little dirty, but note that the cosmoline may be hiding rust or bulges. However, if buying a used Mosin, it should have been cleaned and no cosmoline should remain.\r\n - On the whole this next point is not a big issue, but to some it matters. Repair of the crown, or counter-boring, is done to a rifle that has received some sort of damage on the muzzle end of the rifle's barrel and is detectable by running your finger around for about an inch inside the muzzle and not feeling any rifling. You may lose a small amount of velocity and accuracy, but it is rather inconsequential. If you prefer a rifle which has not been damaged enough to require repair, then keep looking, there are plenty out there.\r\n\r\nFor tons more info check out [7.62x54r.net][1] (general info), and these forum threads: [this one from calguns.net][2], www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-482070.html , and www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-385289.html (what to look for when buying).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://7.62x54r.net/\r\n  [2]: http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?p=6450730"}

The biggest differences are going to be in muzzle velocity and sight radius. A shorter barrel is going to give you a slower muzzle velocity, which means your bullet is going to drop more before it reaches the target (also, when it hits the sound barrier, it will deflect in weird ways). The shorter sight radius is going to make it more difficult to repeatedly line your sights up on a distant target. \r\n\r\nBasically, a 2\" revolver, properly fired, can hit a 10 inch target at 25 yards all day (in a vice, you'll probably even get good groups).

A turret is substantially less complex than a progressive, but is considerably faster than a single stage press.  It also lets you keep all your dies set up as you move through the reloading process, rather than having to reset them after every step.\r\n\r\nA big factor in this decision is what kind of reloading you're doing.  Is this volume reloading, cranking out large numbers of low-cost rounds?  Accuracy reloading, producing a few, carefully made rounds made to the highest standards of precision?  Specialty reloading to produce a round not commercially available (making major with certain calibers in gun games, etc.)?  Will you be reloading one caliber, or many?

The advantage is that there are many many tactical ad-ons for the Mossy. I tricked mine out with a tri-rail forearm, ATI folding stock with shell holder, front grip with a shotgun-rated laser/tactical flashlight. Was thinking of going with the ghost ring system but am pretty convinced to avoid it after getting advice here.\r\n\r\nThe Stoeger 2000 semi-auto also has a black combo that has the short and long barrels. But there are almost no bolt-on tactical accessories for it, though they do \"sell\" a pistol-grip camo stock as a part of their turkey hunting setup. But they are notoriously out-of-stock on individual components, so I don't really recommend it, if you are looking to construct a full tactical setup.\r\n\r\nWhen shooting birds, I just take the front grip off the rail, leave the stock extended and drop in the longer barrel when using the Mossy. The pistol grip makes shooting dove a bit different than with a normal stock. But last time out, I was successful and am getting better the more I shoot with the tactical stock."}

Start with the feet: shoulder width apart, maybe a little wider, one foot a little further forward than the other.  Knees bent to lower the center of gravity.  Lean your upper body forward a bit to absorb recoil and perhaps a physical impact from your adversary.  Not a radical lean, just enough to put your shoulders over your toes.  Grasp the pistol in a proper two handed grip (a subject for another question).  Extend your arms and bring it up to eye level.  Exactly how your arms are positioned is going to vary depending on your body type and the length of your arms.

For the context of this question, I would add to that answer that a true 5.56mm NATO spec chamber is also the best all around chamber for a rifle, be it for hobby, gun games, or fighting guns. Exceptions to this would include shooting extremely long bullets which require custom chambers due to the overall length of the rounds, or chambers from makers like LaRue (Wylde) and Noveske (Mod 0) where their work has proven to be reliable under many extreme conditions."}

It's good out to way past 1500 meters, but until you're a hot-shot precision shooter you're just going to be throwing money into the wind at those ranges.\r\n\r\n<strong>I'd stick with the .308 simply because while it may not be the best at everything, it's <em>really really good</em> at a lot of things and if you're still learning, you won't push its limits for a good long while.</strong> It has a lot of intangible benefits that will make learning more enjoyable (easily managed recoil), easier (tons of available ballistic/reloading info, aftermarket, flexibility of platform), cheaper (reloading components and factory ammo massively available, flexibility of platform), and faster (you'll <strong>practice more</strong>)."}

A G.I. rack grade 1911 may do fine when you slam the slide on the empty chamber, but a gun with a tuned trigger and fitted barrel will do better without it. The jarring of the slide slamming down on an empty chamber can cause the hammer to follow and the sear nose to crash into the hammer hooks. Your trigger job will last longer if you ease the slide down. Further, the lower lugs on a match fit barrel take a lot of impact when they contact the slide stop, and without the buffering effect of the round feeding into the chamber, you increase wear on your barrel by slamming the slide on an empty chamber. It's not the end of the world if the slide drops on an empty chamber, but it's not a good habit to develop either. It is the sign of an amateur 1911 handler.\r\n"}

Additionally, often take the pistol to a range and squeeze off the rounds that have been carried in this configuration, or at least swap out the rounds with fresh ones on a relatively frequent basis, especially if you are carrying in a hot and or humid climate.\r\n\r\nFinally, use common sense with a pocket holster--don't use it with tight clothing (like jeans),or with something flimsy (like nylon shorts) that would easily reveal the silhouette of the weapon. The pocket should be deep and strong enough to accommodate the holster.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://seecamp.com/photos.htm"}

A primary advantage of the 1911 platform is the trigger, so it makes sense to get a trigger of a length appropriate for you and adjust the trigger pull to something you're comfortable with.  \r\n\r\nGood sights are next - but don't bother until you have a trigger that works for you.  Good sights provide a front sight you can get a visual focus on, and nothing more.  Dots, bars, and dancing girls are all unnecessary features - you may like them, but they aren't strictly necessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, customize the stock (\"grip\") to suit your hand.

A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small \"heat shield\" has gone missing!\r\n\r\n* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.\r\n\r\n* Look at the cylinder's \"star\" at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.\r\n\r\n* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.\r\n\r\nWith the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is \"full lockup\" - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:\r\n\r\n* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.\r\n\r\n* Check for \"rotational wiggle\".  A little is OK on S&Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.\r\n\r\n* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  **UNLOAD** it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a \"circle behind a circle\"\r\neffect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the \"loose rotational lockup\" guns (S&W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's\r\npossible to \"nudge\" the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.\r\n\r\n* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is\r\nminimal, .003\" to .004\" optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006\" I'd be\r\nunhappy with it.\r\n\r\n* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's\r\nnext \"click\".\r\n\r\n* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  \r\n\r\n* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer\r\nbar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.\r\n\r\n* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger \"transfer bar pinch\" issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc."}

Competition, Carry/Self Defense, Range Plinking, Safe Queen?\r\n\r\nIf you are looking at an entry level gun with the intent of upgrading, ask some gunsmiths what they recommend.  I know a few that will work on base Colts and Springfields, while others will not work on Kimbers or customer-supplied stripped frames.  \r\n\r\nI have a few off-the-shelf 1911s that were upgraded and one has nothing left other than the frame, plunger tube, ejector, slide and main spring housing pin as original with everything else being replaced in one session.\r\n\r\nYou asked a very loaded question to what can be upgraded and what is fluff?  You will get answers all over the map with none of the answers being wrong or right.  The joys of 1911 ownership is the absolute personalization that one can do to the gun for their personal tastes and uses.\r\n\r\nGood quality (match grade) parts are not cheap, but are worth the premium over their MIM counterparts (IMHO), especially in a high round count gun.  Learning or locating a good gun smith to install these parts is the trick.  You could have the highest quality hammer, sear and disconnecter and if they are fitted wrong, you just wasted time, money and potentially made your gun unsafe.  \r\n\r\nOne shooter's fluff is another shooter's necessity.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, if I had an entry level gun that needed upgrading, I would start in this logical progression:\r\n\r\nWhat causes (or fixes) malfunctions and what breaks?  Get a good set of magazines, a quality fitted extractor (get two), make sure the feed ramp is the proper angle and polished.  Make sure the plunger tube is properly staked as is the ejector.\r\n\r\nTo make the gun more comfortable to shoot, I would start with good quality trigger and fire control bits.  Bar stock sear, disconnecter, hammer with a good trigger fitted to your hand and acceptable, reliable, safe trigger weight for the use of the gun. \r\n\r\nTo compliment the trigger, look at the controls \u2013 safety, slide stop, grip safety and sights.  Do you need a larger safety?  Single side or ambi?  Does your manual of arms use the slide stop as a slide release and can you use a higher profile stop?  High beaver tail grip safety with memory bump?  What kind of sights?  Higher and narrower with more light around the front sight?  Lo-mount sights?  Black/black or night sights?  Adjustable? \r\n\r\nWe have made the gun more comfortable to shoot and a bit more personalized to the shooter, let's futz around on the accuracy department. Is the original barrel serviceable?  Would simply exchanging the barrel bushing and inspecting the points of lock-up improve the accuracy to a level we expect, or do we need to go the route of an oversized barrel, link and bushing set? \r\n\r\nNow, let's cut up the frame...  Do you want an undercut trigger guard to help your hands get higher on the gun?  Checkering on the front strap and main spring housing \u2013 20, 25 or 30lpi?  Checkering under the trigger guard, back of the slide and/or flat top the slide with serrations?  Finish it off with a set of grips...  G10, wood, rubber?  What level of aggressiveness on the grips?  Rough Gunners or smooth wood?\r\n\r\nTime for the finish.  What color do you want it and what do you want to protect it from?  Nicks and scratches or holster wear?  Humidity or sweaty hands?  Do you want it pretty in pink or coyote tan to match your khaki pants?  Black goes with everything, unless you want it blued."}

I don't agree with grease as a proper lubricant for firearms.  When grease is used in varied applications, it is in a \u201cclosed\u201d system where the migration of the lubricant is limited to the confines of the closed system.  This closed system prevents the contamination from outside sources (dirt, dust, residue of combustion, etc) as these contaminants suspended inside the grease act as a very effective abrasive compound.  As an armorer, I have seen the effects of this abrasive effect on rifles, LMGs and handguns.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with CLP or Break Free as \u201cproper\u201d lubricants.  Suspending teflon or the idea of being a 'cleaner' or 'protectant' in the same bottle as a lubricant does not make a proper lube.  Solvents are cleaners, protectants are varnishes and neither belong in the same bottle as a lubricant, no matter the label.\r\n\r\nI have not found anything as effective, cost-effective or ubiquitous as using synthetic motor oil as a firearm lubricant.  I can spill more than I use and still have plenty of lubed guns with a $7.00 quart of Mobil 1 from Target.  Most \u201cgun lubes\u201d are nothing more than a synth base with inert additives.  Even the ever-popular Miltec 25 is simply a synth gear oil for heavy equipment, packaged and sold (with a significant margin) for the shooting public.  \r\n\r\nThe most important part of the lubrication process is where you lube, not what you lube with.  While the owner's manual is a good start, asking what lubricants actually do will give you an idea of where to place your lubricant.  \u201cWhere do I have metal on metal contact, where do I want to reduce friction, protect against wear due to the reciprocation of parts and where do I want to prevent galling?\u201d  Answering those questions will give you the precise locations of where you should apply your liquid lubricants.  Putting KY Jelly on the corrects parts > putting oil on the wrong parts.\r\n\r\nYes, liquid lubricants do migrate and evaporate.  It is up to the user to ensure their firearm is properly maintained and serviceable.  That may mean reapplying lubricant at regular intervals even if the gun isn't fired/used.  Grease is a lazy method to decrease that inspection frequency and can significantly decrease the service life of the firearm due to accelerated wear. "}

Consider ahead of time - where in the house will you and your loved ones be, and where might an attacker come from? Can you position yourself and everyone else such that there are no innocents in the direction of the attacker?

The datum surface varies by caliber.  On most rimless / rebated rim straight-walled brass it is the case mouth.  On rimmed cartridges it is the forward edge of the rim.  On a belted cartridge, it is the forward edge of the belt, and on most other necked cartridges it is a point on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nNormally you check headspace, rather than actually measure it.  (That is, you're looking for pass / fail rather than a number).  That said, headspace is checked with a set of two gauges - a 'go' gauge which proves that the chamber will accept a round, and a 'no-go' gauge which proves that the chamber will not chamber an out-of-spec round.  To test, you want to remove any spring-tension, such as might be caused by the ejector in an AR-15 bolt, or the cocking mechanism on an Enfield.  That done, you attempt to close the action on each of the gauges.  The action should close easily on the 'go' gauge, but not close on the 'no go' gauge.  The 'no-go' gauge is the one you normally are concerned with.  If the action closes on a no-go gauge the chamber is too deep.  At best this will result in overly deformed cases during firing, but it could also lead to a case rupture, which can be dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf a rifle is found to have excessive headspace (closes on the 'no-go' gauge) it can be 'set back' on most rifles by a gunsmith as long as the chamber is relatively intact.  Some rifles (the AK's come to mind) and most pistols aren't worth the effort and would warrant a barrel replacement."}

There are 7 stations arranged in a semi-circle starting under the high house and rotating around to in front of the low house, with an eighth station centered between the houses.  A shooter progresses from station to station.  At each station you may be required to fire at single birds and doubles (one thrown from each house).  The course finishes in between the houses firing one shot each at birds thrown one at a time from each of the two houses.  A perfect score is 24.  Because a box of shells is 25, it's typical to allow a 'mulligan' - a single opportunity to re-try a shot at the shooters discretion once per round.\r\n\r\nTrap is a game with a single house downrange of the shooter and five stations that the shooter rotates through.  The stations are close together, so it's a lot like shooting from the same spot.  Bird can fly out at any angle, but due to the position of the house are always some 'going away' shot.  People who shoot trap regularly get to the point where it becomes a competition to see who can stay awake the longest as round after round proceeds before anyone gets bored and misses. ;)\r\n\r\nSporting Clays is intended to simulate actual bird hunting.  Typical Sporting Clays is run as either 5-stand or 10-stand.  Each stand has a different shooting challenge and if you shoot at multiple clubs you will see tremendous variety.  Stations may be named after the birds they emulate (Teal, grouse, etc.).  You will shoot at clays fling toward you and over your head, straight up, straight across, but visible only between to trees, or a clay and a 'rabbit' (a special thick clay that is bounced along the ground), or a hen shoot (two orange clay targets and a white or yellow target all thrown together - the orange are targets the 'hen' is a penalty if you hit it) and many other imaginative stands.  Due to the variety, sporting clays is easily the most challenging and humbling of the three, but also the most time and resource intensive.  \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy shotgun shooting you should try all of them, as each offers something different.

They are usually the product of a mis-fed SAW or a double-fed M4/M16. We have never had an issue with rounds that have not had bullet angle compromised.\r\n\r\nWe can do this in the military because we have quality rifles (Colt M4s, FN Herstal M16s) and use quality ammunition. If your rifle is of questionable specification or low quality (DPMS, Bushmaster, Rock River), or the ammo is not an acceptable quality factory ammo (Tula, Wolf, steel cased) or has an unknown history (reloads you bought from a friend with no idea how many times the brass has been reloaded) then I would advise against shooting it.\r\n\r\nIf the crimp is bad enough to get the bullet pointing in a direction that is not straight forward, we toss the rounds and don't use them. Not because they're a safety hazard (although they may be) but because they generally will never feed properly again, which makes them annoying. We also toss rounds that have been so badly damaged that the metal has a hard crease (think like a crease in your pants, not just a dent). Hard-creased rounds have generally been damaged in more places than just the spot where the crease is, and the neck where the bullet seats is often lose and allows the bullet to move if pressed on. Also not good for feeding, and if the bullet falls out it makes a mess of powder and the loose bullet can jam things up.\r\n\r\nGenerally I wouldn't worry too much about the round having some ill effect on your gun if something bad were to happen at the point of the crimp. The neck of the cartridge and the entire body of the cartridge is supported all around by the chamber of the rifle."}

Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas of such firearms;\r\n\r\n2.  Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and\r\n\r\n3.  Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event.\r\n\r\nFirearms automatically attain C&R status when they are 50 years old. Any firearm that is at least 50 years old, and in its original configuration, would qualify as a C&R firearm. It is not necessary for such firearms to be listed in ATF\u2019s C&R list. Therefore, ATF does not generally list firearms in the C&R publication by virtue of their age. However, if you wish for a classification of your particular firearm under categories (b) or (c) above and wish your item to be listed, you may submit the weapon to the Firearms Technology Branch (FTB) for a formal classification.\r\n\r\nPlease note that firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act (NFA) may be classified as C&R items, but still may be subject to the provisions of the NFA. If your C&R item is an NFA firearm (e.g., Winchester Trappers) and you desire removal from the NFA status, you must submit it to FTB for evaluation and a formal classification"}

Usually, this autoforward is a result of a confluence of events and manipulations that relieve the spring tension of the slide against the slide stop, the stop lowers and slide moves forward.  Guns that have a relatively weak recoil spring due to wear or design, geometry of the slide stop and slide relief surface, position of the handgun, amount of force used to insert the magazine, and the cleanliness of the operating parts can have an impact to whether a handgun will autoforward or not.\r\n\r\nDue to this confluence of events, I don't see using or expecting a handgun to autoforward as a viable technique during a slide lock reload.  Rather, I see it as a \u201cfreebie.\u201d \r\n\r\nCouple of major problems with the technique:\r\n\r\n1. It isn't reliable.  Changing any of the above conditions above will have a direct impact if the slide will autoforward.  99 out of 100 isn't good enough.  Defeating the slide stop manually or overhand gripping the slide to defeat the slide stop has proven 100% reliable on a significant number of handgun platforms and I trust those techniques significantly more.\r\n2. What do you do when it doesn't happen?  I have seen many shooters who have grown used to this autoforward go into brain fade when it fails.  They would continually slap the floorplate of the now-seated magazine trying to get the slide to autoforward when the simple task of manually defeating the slide stop or overhand gripping the gun would get it up and running in a shorter period of time.\r\n3. Timing.  I have seen (and experienced) handguns autoforward before the magazine is fully seated and locked resulting in the slide going forward on an empty chamber.\r\n  "}

Here is a short list of common safety features on modern handguns:\r\n\r\nFiring pin safety.  A block actuated by a plunger that inhibits the forward motion of the firing pin into and past the breech face.  There are usually defeated by the act of pressing the trigger or the grip safety (Schwartz style on Kimber and S&W 1911s)\r\n\r\nDisconnector.  Prevents the discharge of a shot when the gun is out of battery by \u201cdisconnecting\u201d the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.\r\n\r\nTrigger Safety.  Most common on Glocks, a pivoting and spring loaded block that prevents rearward motion of the trigger unless a finger or other object covers the center face of the trigger, defeating the block.\r\n\r\nManual Safety.  A manual switch that prevents rearward travel of the trigger (1911) or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.  Some manual safeties lock the slide as well (1911, Taurus PT92.)\r\n\r\nGrip Safety.  Usually on the backstap of the gun, depressing the grip safety unblocks the trigger or ensures the proper trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.\r\n\r\nSqueeze Cocker.  Exclusively on the HK P7, the squeeze action of the grip safety (cocker) on the front strap cocks the gun and allows it to be fired.  \r\n\r\nSafety Intercept Notch.  A cut in the hammer of DA/SA or SA pistols is a cut in the hammer that is oversized to intercept the hammer in the case of sear failure.\r\n\r\nLoaded Chamber Indicator.  Visual and possible tactile indication that there is a round chambered.  Most modern handguns will have the extractor geometry (Glock, HK) indicate whether there is a round chambered.  Other firearms may have a separate component doing as such (Springfield XD) while others have have a simple hole in the chamber for visual confirmation.\r\n\r\nDecocker.  Safely decocks and lowers the hammer from Single Action to Double Action without the need to press the trigger.  Can block the firing pin striker (Beretta 92 series with decock) and/or maintains the integrity of the firing pin safety function.\r\n\r\nMagazine Disconnect.  Prevents the rearward motion of the trigger or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship when there is no magazine inserted into the gun.\r\n\r\nTo list the Pros and Cons of each style would be an exercise in futility, as the relative value of each safety feature is going to be objective from shooter to shooter.  Most modern firearms are going to have a number of passive safety features that are mandated due to import guidelines or \u201cgun safety\u201d laws in varied jurisdictions.  It would be very difficult to find a modern handgun design that does not incorporate a firing pin safety, disconnector, safety intercept notch (on hammer fired DA/SA handguns).  On guns with light single action only trigger presses (1911, XD, P7), you will be hard-pressed finding a gun without an external safety and/or grip style safety.      "}

Here is a short list of common safety features on modern handguns:\r\n\r\nFiring pin safety.  A block actuated by a plunger that inhibits the forward motion of the firing pin into and past the breech face.  There are usually defeated by the act of pressing the trigger (Series 80 1911s and the vast majority of modern designs, Glock, HK, Sig, etc) or the grip safety (Schwartz style on Kimber Series II and S&W 1911s).\r\n\r\nDisconnector.  Prevents the discharge of a shot when the gun is out of battery by \u201cdisconnecting\u201d the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship until the slide is forward and in battery.\r\n\r\nTrigger Safety.  Most common on Glocks, a pivoting and spring loaded block that prevents rearward motion of the trigger unless a finger or other object covers the center face of the trigger, defeating the block.\r\n\r\nManual Safety.  A manual switch that prevents rearward travel of the trigger (1911) or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.  Some manual safeties lock the slide as well (1911, Taurus PT92.)\r\n\r\nGrip Safety.  Usually on the backstap of the gun, depressing the grip safety unblocks the trigger or ensures the proper trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.\r\n\r\nSqueeze Cocker.  Exclusively on the HK P7, the squeeze action of the grip safety (cocker) on the front strap cocks the gun and allows it to be fired when the trigger is pressed in SA.  \r\n\r\nSafety Intercept Notch.  An oversized cut in the hammer of DA/SA or SA pistols to intercept the hammer in the case of sear failure.  Also known as \"half cock\" on 1911 style firearms.\r\n\r\nLoaded Chamber Indicator.  Visual and possible tactile indication that there is a round chambered.  Most modern handguns will have the extractor geometry (Glock, HK) to indicate whether there is a round chambered.  Other firearms may have a separate component doing as such (Springfield XD) while others have have a simple hole in the chamber for visual confirmation.\r\n\r\nDecocker.  Safely decocks and lowers the hammer from Single Action to Double Action without the need to press the trigger.  Can block the firing pin striker (Beretta 92 series with decock) and/or maintains the integrity of the firing pin safety function.\r\n\r\nMagazine Disconnect.  Prevents the rearward motion of the trigger or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship when there is no magazine inserted into the gun.\r\n\r\nTo list the Pros and Cons of each style would be an exercise in futility, as the relative value of each safety feature is going to be objective from shooter to shooter.

This isn't 100%, but it's followed for most gun designs.\r\n\r\nManual safeties are pretty much standard for single-action firearms (handguns and long guns), where the gun is meant to be carried with the hammer cocked and a short and light trigger would be all that prevents it from discharging. I'm not aware of any firearms like this that don't have a manual safety.\r\n\r\nDouble-action revolvers, where a long and heavy trigger pull cocks and then releases the hammer, almost never have safeties, as the long and heavy trigger pull is considered to be enough safety.\r\n\r\nSingle-action revolvers also generally have no safeties, as they are meant to be carried with the hammer down on an empty chamber, so that you would have to manually cock the hammer to fire it.\r\n\r\nAutoloaders with double-single actions (the hammer can be cocked manually or by the gun's action, giving a single-action pull, or it can be cocked and released by the trigger with a double-action pull) may or may not have a manual safety. They generally have a way to drop the hammer and return it to double-action mode safely (see Sig-Sauer decockers), and some have a manual safety that decocks the hammer and can be left on (such as most Beretta handguns). Double-action only autoloaders, where the trigger is always longer and heavier than a single-action, usually don't have manual safeties.\r\n\r\nAutoloaders with double-action only or variations on that blur the line a little. True double-action only guns, where the trigger fully cocks and releases the hammer every time, and it can be pulled again without cycling the action, don't usually have safeties for the same reason as double-action revolvers. Newer striker-fired guns like the Glock, M&P, and XD aren't true double action guns as the striker must be cocked for each trigger pull, but the trigger pull is much longer and heaver than single-action guns, if not as much as a true double-action. Because of this, they usually omit the manual safety just like the double-actions.\r\n\r\nHandgun trainers generally consider these striker-fired guns with no manual safety to be no less safe than any other handgun provided the same basic safety rules are followed. However, some of them (S&W M&P, for example) have an option for a manual safety to satisfy any departments, militaries, or corporations that have policies requiring manual safeties, or individuals that prefer them.\r\n"}

Most of the accidents attributed to the missing safeties on modern handguns were caused by bad holsters or simple negligence during manipulation with the firearm.  \r\nThe question whether or not to have to have a manual safety on a handgun depends entirely on the user's shooting and/or carry style.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHistorically, I think the reason why most of the handguns had manual safeties was simply because gun safety was taught that way in the police/military (and most handguns are developed with law enforcement and military in mind), so it was considered a standard. I think Glock was the first to mass-produce a gun completely without manual safeties (I don't count the \"safety\" on the trigger) and made it popular. Today, many handgun designs offer the option \"with\" or \"without\" a manual safety (e.g. CZ, GP / STI-GP, H&K, ...)."}

All three of these calibers, as well as your choice in equipment and allocation of funds are terrible choices for your stated goal of \"learning long range shooting.\"\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to invest $5000 in JUST an upper, how much are you willing to spend on a scope? <strong>Quality glass will take you MUCH farther than a high-end rifle</strong>, and as you upgrade your rifle it's an investment you can carry with you. That's a pretty healthy budget, and I have to wonder how much you've set aside for ammo and training.\r\n\r\n<strong>Very-large-caliber uppers are an extremely niche item, and I'd recommend you use one of the widely available .308 AR-platform guns if you want to learn on a magazine-fed semi-auto.</strong> In the AR-platform .308 market $5000 can get you a rifle, a <em>really good</em> scope, an <em>exceptional</em> scope mount, a fair amount of ammo and leave you with a couple hundred dollars left to find good training.\r\n\r\nTo speak again about the quality of scopes, if you're shooting at ranges that warrant any of these calibers (a <em>minimum</em> of 1000 yards unless you're shooting at armor or material targets, which you're not), a quality scope is not just optional but required. <strong>At these very long ranges the things that make lower quality scopes lower quality will dramatically hinder your ability to get solid and consistent hits.</strong>\r\n\r\nFinally, <strong>I recommend you review this question regarding long range caliber selection: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/516/what-is-a-good-commonly-available-long-range-cartridge/520#520</strong>. I outlined in my answer there the myriad reasons for selecting an entirely different caliber than the three you've listed. Especially emphasized in my answer there is the ability to practice more. To become proficient at long-range shooting you will need to fire many thousands of rounds, and these three calibers are really only feasible for learning if the ammo is supplied to you at no cost (say, by a police department or the military) or you're independently wealthy."}

The blowback operating system of the pistol (5 points missed for no locking breech) combined with the caliber (7 points missed for being under 9x19mm) makes it miss the minimum. A change to either of these would allow its import.\r\n\r\nThe point system can be seen in a <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-5.pdf\">PDF</a> on the ATF website.\r\n\r\nThese pistols were really only created for people in countries that prohibit citizens from owning weapons in \"military calibers\" so there's very little market for them here in the US.

In a fixed-power scope there are fewer moving parts and less to go wrong. They usually stand up better to hard impacts and especially hard use. What you give up is the ability to lower magnification and widen your field of view on closer-ranged or moving targets, or enhance the level of detail you're able to see by increasing magnification.\r\n\r\nFixed power scopes are also less expensive to manufacture because of the decreased number of parts required. Because of this you're able to get a better quality scope for the same price as a lesser-quality variable-power scope. \r\n\r\nI've never done varmint hunting, so I'm not sure how much movement of the target is involved. Fixed-power scopes at close range can make it hard to quickly acquire a target and easy to lose them if they leave your field of vision. At longer ranges as the target fills less of the scope, this is mitigated.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that lower-quality, variable-power scopes often will not give you their highest magnification level without distorting the image in some way. I haven't done much reading about the SWFA glass because I've not considered buying it, but it may be another thing to look into for you before making your purchase."}

Take a brand new piece of empty brass (or a fired piece of brass that you've polished the scratches out of).  Put it into you magazine and chamber it (without a bullet there, you might have to carefully help guide it into the chamber with your fingers).  Extract it, and see if the scratch is there.\r\n 2. Alternately, next time you fire the rifle, put a round of ammo directly into the chamber (don't feed it from the magazine).  Extract the round, unfired - if it has a scratch, it is due to the extraction process.  If it is not scratched, chamber it again (directly) and fire it.

But as you say though, there can be a really big difference in the subjective comfort level.  Here are some things that make a rifle more miserable to shoot:\r\n\r\n 1. more muzzle blast (e.g. from a shorter barrel, or a muzzle brake, or choice of cartridge/load that affects muzzle exit pressure).  The rifle doesn't actually hit you any harder, but it can become a pretty big psychological exercise to deal with this and not let it affect you\r\n 2. rifle fit (an extension of the metal butt plate comment).  If a rifle has a hard and pokey bit of the stock that hits you just wrong, it will hurt you more than a rifle that fits your body better.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have fired a Sako .375 H&H in relative comfort; it's a powerful rifle but it fitted me reasonably well.  It's a handful, but it is not unpleasant nor painful.  But I have a Marlin 336 in .32 Win Special (30-30 equivalent) and the cheekpiece tends to whack my face pretty viciously - it is one of only two rifles I've ever fired that actually hurt me.\r\n\r\nAn interesting exercise to try if you have the opportunity to do this safely - take a .30-06 hunting rifle and from a standing position hold it at waist level horizontally (at \"from the hip level\", but hold it like a pendulum and don't rest the butt against you).  When you fire the rifle you'll be amazed at how little recoil there actually is, it just sort of gently pops back a few inches.  But if that rifle is held in such a way that the scope or stock gets a good run at you, it can really hurt.\r\n"}

If you need to shoot, you need to shoot quickly, you need to move quickly and know where the limit is for a given distance and target size.  In other words, if you train to be slow, you will be slow.  This isn't a license to be sloppy and demonstrate poor marksmanship, but rather having acceptable marksmanship in the shortest time possible.  If you are involved in a shooting, medical professionals will not be marking your hits on the threat for score.  Only hits count.\r\n\r\nHow fast is too fast and how slow is too slow? Through proper practice and training, you will find the tempo that is appropriate for the distance and size.  Think, \u201cGoldilocks,\u201d too fast, too slow, just right.  Work on a target at varied distances with varied tempos. Say, 3, 7 and 10 yds with three distinct shot tempos at each distance.  Shoot a pair with the intended result being two bullets, one hole.  Speed up the tempo to a reasonable cadence, maybe 1.5 sec split time between shots and the third tempo, put your foot on the gas and attempt to fire two rounds as fast as possible.  You will find the proper tempo for your skill level, distance and target size.\r\n\r\nWhat is the appropriate sight alignment and sight picture for a given target at X distance?  While the textbook \u201cfront sight post centered in the rear sight notch, flat and even across with a crisp front sight focus\u201d may be appropriate for the head shot, trying to put a round between the running lights of your target at 10yds; that same sighting technique may not be appropriate if you are trying to put two rounds high in the chest at 5yds.  That larger target and the shorter distance will allow for more sight \u201cslop\u201d than the further, smaller target. How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?\r\n\r\nThe same can be said about your trigger manipulation.  Same small target at 10yds, a smooth consistent press to the rear of the trigger, with a surprise break is textbook.  How much time are your burning if you applied the same manipulation technique as the target increases in size and is closer?  Are you minimizing the amount of distance your trigger finger and trigger have to travel by working the reset of your given firearm?  Are you burning time (and adding in margins of error) by having to reacquire the center face of the trigger and/or take up the slack for every follow-up shot?  How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?\r\n\r\nWith those two points above, let me reiterate \u2013 don't sacrifice practical, combative accuracy for speed.  Only hits count and it is up to you to find that point that your sight speed and trigger speed is \u201cgood enough\u201d for the size and distance of the target.\r\n\r\nAre you taking advantage of your body mechanics to most effectively manage or recover from the recoil impulse as you are resetting the trigger and managing your sights?  Does your platform (stance) lower your center of gravity and push it just forward of your toes?  Does your platform allow your firearm return back to target after the recoil impulse to where it was just before the shot broke or are you \u201cmuscling\u201d it back to target because you are not taking advantage of your natural point of aim?\r\n\r\nIs your dominant (trigger) hand high up on the backstrap of the gun and is your support hand getting as much contact on the gun as possible?  Crossed thumbs and/or support index finger on the front of the trigger guard will result in your hand losing contact with the gun, diminishing your ability to recover from recoil.\r\n\r\nLook at the top shooters in the world and they have many things in common and one being highly defined and toned forearms and upper body.  Resulting in a very strong grip without fatigue and larger muscles absorbing the recoil forces. If you are trying to \u201cstabilize\u201d the gun with an ever-tightening grip and those muscle groups fatigue easily, your sight wobble will be worse despite trying to correct for it.  A self-fulfilling prophesy, if you will.  Get yourself a set of kettlebells and look for the \u201cShooter's Push-up.\u201d  Isolates and works the muscles a shooter needs developed... \r\n\r\nBreathe.  In with the good, out with the bad.  Don't hold your breath, your brain will need the fresh oxygen in the blood and when you hold your breath, you are depriving your gray matter of that oxygen resulting in lots of nastiness.  Lot's of good information out there covering \u201ccombative breathing.\u201d \r\n\r\nGood luck reducing those split times."}

This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.</strong> Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting. A 1:9 barrel will have trouble with loads much heavier than the mid-60gr range, which puts many very effective defense, long range, and hunting loads outside their ability to stabilize.\r\n\r\nSimply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. <strong>Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber and material(s) can only grow in length as they increase in weight.</strong> To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.\r\n\r\n#Bullet stability and twist rate\r\nTwist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (\"one-in-seven\") twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability\">Greenhill Formula</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png\" alt=\"The Greenhill Formula\" />\r\n\r\n - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\r\n - D = bullet's diameter in inches\r\n - L = bullet's length in inches\r\n - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\r\n\r\nNote that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. <strong>The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.</strong> \r\n\r\nEarly AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior."}

The upgraded system is applicable only to Glock pistols with the following serial number ranges :\r\n\r\n* Glock 17 - alpha prefixes AA - WF\r\n* Glock 19 - alpha prefixes through WJ\r\n* Glock 20 - alpha prefixes through WW\r\n* Glock 21 - alpha prefixes through XL\r\n* Glock 22 - alpha prefixes through YA\r\n* Glock 23 - alpha prefixes through SK\r\n\r\nAnd from [GlockFAQ](http://www.glockfaq.com) via [J.D. Locke](http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-755.html) on \"The High Road\"\r\n\r\n* Inspect the frame internal parts (trigger assembly, connector, locking block, etc.). Some early pistols need to be upgraded -- the metal internal components of which typically have a black finish as opposed to the current silver finish. Look under the slide at the bottom of the firing pin lug and firing pin safety; look at the trigger bar inside the frame. If these parts are black in color, the pistol needs an upgrade kit. If the parts are dull or shiny silver, it should be fine. Another way to tell if the pistol was made before the update is that the frame serial number plate will be black as opposed to silver, which is the current configuration. If you buy a pistol that needs upgrading, you can take it to a Glock armorer or send it to the Glock Warranty Department where they will perform all the necessary upgrades at no charge.\r\n"}

The 1911 with an external extractor (like the Dan Wesson models that never worked and the Kimber models that almost worked a little) could snap over a round without risking damage.

The most likely cause though is cosmoline that was not removed.

You can either use a heat gun to melt the cosmoline off, or you can soak the parts in solvent for a while. To remove cosmoline from the chamber, use a good solvent with a chamber brush mounted in a power drill (at a fairly slow speed). Afterwards inspect the chamber to be sure no bits of cleaning brush or any other debris is left in the chamber.

The pattern depends on the individual gun, choke, and ammunition (which varies by shot size, weight, manufacturer, etc), and also on things like air temperature and wind. Then there's also the matter of whether the pellets still have enough energy to break the target when they get there.\r\n\r\nWhile #8 and #9 have been found to work best by a large number of people, that doesn't mean they'll be what's best for you. It's very likely though that they *will* be good enough to go out and hit some targets and have fun, especially if you're just starting out, so you don't have to get worked up about it right away. However, to find the *best* pattern, you have to try various chokes and types of ammunition in your particular gun. Even between two guns which are identical on paper (same mfgr, model, choke, ammo, etc) there can be differences in patterns, so everyone has to [do their own experimentation](http://www.chuckhawks.com/why_pattern.htm).\r\n\r\nYou can decide for yourself how obsessive you want to get in your research. A good starting point would be to try 3-5 different types of ammo (different shot sizes will give the biggest pattern differences) through 1 or 2 chokes which should give you a sense of what the differences are, what will work for you, and what direction to look if you want to experiment further."}

The best solution is to loctite the bushings in place, and get some thin nylon or fiber washers to put under the grip screws.  If you'd like a thicker grip, as I do, you can put a piece of pond liner (like inner tube rubber, but flat) under the entirety of the grip and that will also do the trick.  A more equipment intensive solution is to counterbore the back side of the grip for a nylon washer."}

Lucky for you, <a href=\"http://www.onlylongrange.com/badnews.asp\">such a rifle</a> exists. The Bad News .338 LM semi-automatic (now available in .300 WM). You won't get closer to keeping the same manual of arms unless you somehow shrunk it down.\r\n\r\nFor only uppers available in both .338 LM and .50 BMG, you can see <a href=\"http://www.tactilite.com/\">TacLite</a>. Some of these models also take Accuracy International magazines in the off chance you get an AI bolt-gun in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, in .50 BMG you have the option of the <a href=\"http://www.ferret50.com/ordering.html\">Ferret 50</a>. They also offer lowers dedicated to the task of attaching very-large-caliber uppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following portion of my answer may not be a direct answer to your question but based on the information you've given through question and comments, I can't recommend strongly enough that you reconsider your plan. All three of these calibers, as well as your choice in equipment and allocation of funds are terrible choices for your stated goal of \"learning long range shooting.\"\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to invest $5000 in JUST an upper, how much are you willing to spend on a scope? <strong>Quality glass will take you MUCH farther than a high-end rifle</strong>, and as you upgrade your rifle it's an investment you can carry with you. That's a pretty healthy budget, and I have to wonder how much you've set aside for ammo and training.\r\n\r\n<strong>Very-large-caliber uppers are an extremely niche item, and I'd recommend you use one of the widely available .308 AR-platform guns if you want to learn on a magazine-fed semi-auto.</strong> In the AR-platform .308 market $5000 can get you a rifle, a <em>really good</em> scope, an <em>exceptional</em> scope mount, a fair amount of ammo and leave you with a couple hundred dollars left to find good training.\r\n\r\nTo speak again about the quality of scopes, if you're shooting at ranges that warrant any of these calibers (a <em>minimum</em> of 1000 yards unless you're shooting at armor or material targets, which you're not), a quality scope is not just optional but required. <strong>At these very long ranges the things that make lower quality scopes lower quality will dramatically hinder your ability to get solid and consistent hits.</strong>\r\n\r\nFinally, <strong>I recommend you review this question regarding long range caliber selection: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/516/what-is-a-good-commonly-available-long-range-cartridge/520#520</strong>. I outlined in my answer there the myriad reasons for selecting an entirely different caliber than the three you've listed. Especially emphasized in my answer there is the ability to practice more. To become proficient at long-range shooting you will need to fire many thousands of rounds, and these three calibers are really only feasible for learning if the ammo is supplied to you at no cost (say, by a police department or the military) or you're independently wealthy."}

Because of the inherent weakness of bicycle construction, anything that you could attach, even by welding, could be defeated quickly with even a modest handsaw or pry-bar. \r\n\r\nAnother problem you have here is that you may end up violating your state's concealed carry laws as you transition from concealed carry to storage. There is a period of time where your firearm will likely be in plain view as you move it to your storage container.\r\n\r\nI would strongly urge you to contact an attorney about the legality of storing a firearm in a container that is effectively sitting outside in public view.\r\n\r\nIf your travel to work takes you through dangerous areas, I would recommend that you re-evaluate your route to work, or take a car. I know this is not the answer you are hoping for, but the reality of being a concealed firearm carrier is that you must modify your behavior at times, to accomodate the privilege you've been given.\r\n\r\nMy short answer to this question is \"You shouldn't.\"\r\n"}

Most portable safes are made of pretty thin metal, and rely mainly on being hidden.\r\n\r\nIf you feel comfortable discussing the issue with your employer, perhaps they'd allow you to keep the gun locked in case/safe in your office.

Are there techniques to make this easier, or is it pretty much necessary to enlist a friend as a spotter?\r\n\r\nI'm most interested for pistols at relatively short range (10 yards or so), usually 9mm if that makes a difference, but also some .22, .380 and .45.

In one parameter, this lumps together the effects of bullet size, shape, mass etc.\r\n- the __density__ of the air that the bullet travels through.\r\n\r\nYour question relates to the air density, since air density depends on altitude.  The other factors affecting air density are temperature, pressure and humidity.\r\n\r\nAn increase in altitude reduces the air density - the drag on the bullet (the force slowing it down) decreases directly proportionally to this reduction in air density.\r\n\r\nHere are the effects you will observe (and a ballistics program will calculate) from a decrease in air density:\r\n- no change in muzzle velocity\r\n- the bullet will retain more downrange speed\r\n- because of this, the bullet will drop (a bit) less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmtraj-5.1.cgi"}

It seems there are a pair of small metal rods near the trigger assembly that operate independently but need to be in sync.  They were out of alignment, which is really easy to cause, and it seemed to be causing the failure to feed.  I will try to come back and post a picture - it will show the problem in much greater detail than I could ever describe. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Haven't gotten the picture yet (my camera is broken), but I do have a better description.  These two metal rods are actually part of the same metal coil that, in an AK-74 at least, appear to stop before reaching the trigger assembly, but in the Saiga-12, they seem to both need to rest on top of part of the trigger assembly.  What actually seems to be happening is that the trigger was failing to reset because of this - a new shell would be chambered, but the trigger would not reset so you could not fire without a manual cycle.  Again, I will work on getting pictures.  Supposedly getting a new camera as an early Christmas gift, so that should help. :-)"}

I don't know of any no-previous-experience courses which will teach more than one in a single course. Then, you need to decide what it is you're looking to get out of the course. Do you want classroom-only instruction that teaches the basics of a firearm operation, maintenance and safety? Do you want to actually spend time shooting a firearm?\r\n\r\nI typically advise people to find a local NRA Basic course (there are Basic Pistol, Basic Shotgun, and Basic Rifle courses). Many local shooting ranges offer them. Some people complain they are too long for beginners, but for a comprehensive introduction, I like them. Because of the length complaint, many instructors will offer a cut down version called something like \"First Steps\". A great resource for finding ocal instruction is: [NSSF: Learn to Shoot][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for what to watch out for, I'd say to trust your gut. At the complete beginner level, I would steer clear of any class that seems overly concerned with being cool or elite. Talk to the instructor beforehand even over email if that's all you can manage. Ask how the class is run, how they deal with safety, etc. Get a vibe. If you don't click, don't take that class. I do have one concrete warning. Be cautious about anyone saying they \"play by big boy rules\". There are several great instructors who use this to mean they follow the widely accepted rules of firearms safety while having a hot range. Unfortunately I've heard of many new training outfits using this same phrase to describe training scenarios that look like an horrible accident waiting to happen. If someone says that, ask them to clarify. If they won't clarify find someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.nssf.org/shooting/learn/"}

The .357 Sig falls short of the .357 magnum in that regard, but not by very much.  I would still call their ballistics \"comparable\".  In a 125 grain bullet (a common, and popular weight for both rounds) the .357 Magnum gets ~100-150 fps faster than the .357 Sig.  These figures are debatable as there are numerous loadings for both, but in general the Magnum will run a bit hotter than the Sig.\r\n\r\nIt's a judgement call, but I'd say the Sig matches the claim of having comparable ballistics, but falls short of having equivalent ballistics."}

Ackley is the one of the definitive experts on wildcatting, considering he was one of the developers of the .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer cartridge (.380 Weatherby Magnum necked down to .224, pushing a 50gn bullet). A good resource would be his *Handbook for Shooters and Reloaders* (volumes 1 and 2).\r\n\r\nAssuming your receiver and barrel are made of unobtainium, your biggest concern will be the barrel's twist. @Bryson has a fantastic guide to twist [here.][1] If I'm reading it correctly, given some bullet weight/length, optimal twist increases with muzzle velocity.\r\n\r\nOnce you've solved for twist, the problem remains of designing a receiver and action that can handle your increased pressure. Falling Block actions tend to be very sturdy, and are therefore unlikely to blow up in your face. I'm not very well versed in metallurgy, but you'll probably want a chamber and barrel milled out of one piece of billet carbon steel. You'll have to throw that out occasionally, because higher pressures will accelerate throat erosion.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase accuracy at range, you can fiddle with bullet design. Accuracy goes to hell when the bullet crosses the trans-sonic barrier, so decreasing the coefficient of drag and increasing weight (while keeping muzzle velocity constant) increase effective range. \r\n\r\nGood luck and don't lose an eye!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/a/282/12"}

And the police officer might also prefer checking the suspected gun against a paper document than letting you handle it in front of him.  \r\nIt's also worth mentioning that not every police officer is expert on different firearm types so while it may be obvious to many that the gun is not real, it might not be obvious to him/her even after explaining the mechanical differences. A paper document might work better.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's hard to tell you the visible differences if we don't the way the dummy was manufactured.  \r\nAs Daniel already pointed out, the main difference is obviously the inability to fire live ammunition. A dummy is probably missing a chamber (if it's even possible to open it to look inside) or has it blocked somehow to prevent anyone from even trying to fire a real cartridge.

Having two or three spares, providing a similar total round count, seems to be relatively common though. Many people recommend having at least one spare magazine (regardless of capacity) just in case your first magazine develops feeding problems. Might only take a couple seconds to clear up normally, but it's not something you want to do under stress.\r\n\r\nBy carrying a gun in the first place, you're already preparing for something which is fairly unlikely. Fortunately most of us will never need to use a gun to defend ourselves. So you have to decide how unlikely a scenario you want to be prepared for. Keep in mind though that shooting under stress is extremely difficult. Even the police have been in shootouts where 100+ rounds were fired yet no one was hit.\r\n\r\n> it seems to me\r\n> that if you are in a situation that allows you the opportunity to\r\n> safely reload and reengage, you have the opportunity to break contact\r\n> and run - unless you're law enforcement / military and are getting\r\n> paid to be there, this should be your first choice anyway.\r\n\r\nGetting out of a gunfight while you're ahead would always the best choice (after avoiding it in the first place), but it may not always be possible. The threat may be between you and the exit preventing your escape. Or retreating might require you to leave a position where you have relatively good cover, putting you in greater danger. Or there may be other people with you such as elderly parents or small children that aren't able to retreat quickly.\r\n\r\nUltimately, there is no right amount. There are practical limits to what you can carry, and you can never be prepared for every imaginable scenario. Having 2-3 spare normal-capacity magazines is about as much as most people can reasonably manage, and just having a 6+1 with no spares will take care of a lot of possible situations. "}

The rules get a little fuzzier when it comes to sales - technically, you can sell a gun that you built, but if you are building guns for the purpose of selling them to others, then you need a Type 7 FFL (manufacturing license). The exact line is subject to interpretation by courts and federal agents, so it is generally best to stay as far on the good side as you can.\r\n\r\nSee the [ATF's Website][1]:\r\n\r\n> Q: Does the GCA prohibit anyone from making a handgun, shotgun or rifle? \r\n>\r\n> With certain exceptions a firearm may be made by a non-licensee\r\n> provided it is not for sale and the maker is not prohibited from\r\n> possessing firearms. However, a person is prohibited from assembling a\r\n> non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from\r\n> imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a\r\n> tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun\r\n> will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that\r\n> the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.\r\n> \r\n> [18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and\r\n> 479.105]\r\n\r\nOne of the wrinkles is that a receiver that is less than 80% complete is not considered a firearm, and so can be built, bought, and sold just like any other chunk of metal. The exact definition of what constitutes 80% complete is similarly fuzzy, but there are multiple companies selling < 80% receivers intended to be finished at home (see [here][2] and [here][3]).\r\n\r\nFor Title 2 items (machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, destructive devices (guns with caliber > .50 and anything involving explosives), and Any Other Weapons), things get more complex. They can all be made, but they must be registered first, before construction. This means that you can make you own suppressors, AOWs, short-barreled rifles, and shotguns under the same rules, but you must have a NFA [Form 1][4] filed and approved with a tax stamp **before** you start construction. It can be sold to another person only under normal NFA rules (the buyer must have an approved form 4 before they can take possession), and with the same provision that if it looks like you are manufacturing for the purpose of sales, then you need the appropriate manufacturing license.\r\n\r\nMaking machine guns is a special case, because the BATFE will not register machine guns manufactured after 1986 for civilian possession. To register one, and therefore to legally manufacture one, you must be a FFL/SOT.\r\n\r\nDestructive devices are trickier - I don't personally know anyone manufacturing them, and haven't been able to find any solid information about it online. If you intend to manufacture anything involving explosives or large-caliber weapons, it would be best to ask the BATFE directly.\r\n\r\nThat's the legal side. As for the technical side, it is possible to make almost anything at home, given the right tools and equipment. A quality CNC mill and a lathe will cover a lot of bases, and there are plans and forums online in support of fabricating parts for many popular firearms, including 1911 pistols and AR15 rifles. The exact details of what is required depend on the model of firearm, and going into that much detail on metalworking seems beyond the scope of this site (is there a stackexchange site more associated with advanced metalworking/fabrication?).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/general.html#gca-manufacturing\r\n  [2]: http://www.ar15plus.com/default.asp\r\n  [3]: http://www.colfaxtactical.com/\r\n  [4]: http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/form1.html"}

But the simple answer to your question is that, <b>ignoring ALL other factors (including human factors like you cant hit the broad side of a barn, or your target being high on meth and 350 lbs), bigger and faster is better.</b>\r\n\r\nThe longer the projectile becomes, the heavier it becomes. The larger the case, the more speed will be imparted to this heavier projectile. The more velocity behind a mass... Well, now we're in my high school physics class again.\r\n\r\nUpon entering a person a permanent wound cavity is created. The permanent wound cavity is tissue that is torn, punctured, and otherwise damaged in a way that won't heal itself. The more powerfull the bullet \u2014 or rather the more energy left in the bullet upon impact \u2014 the more severe the permanent wound cavity will be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a permanent wound cavity, there is a temporary wound cavity. Again dependent upon the amount of energy left in the bullet upon impact. The easiest way to visualize this is a mold of jello. Put your finger in and pull it out quickly. The hole you made is the permanent wound cavity. It will be smaller than your finger because jello, like our bodies, stretches and is elastic. The more energy imparted by the bullet, the more disruptive to your body this temporary wound cavity will be. \r\n\r\nThis ignores all manner of other factors such as jacket thickness and structural integrity for example. M855 ball ammo issued in the military has a ring where the cartridge neck is crimped to the bullet and sealed for waterproofing. As a side effect, that promotes jacket fragmentation, leaving the lead/steel core exposed to separate further. Longer bullets with more taper will yaw upon entry more severely as the heavier rear end maintains momentum longer than the light front end. Once the bullet begins to yaw, or rotate end over end, the permanent wound cavity expands.

Very \u201cHollywood\u201d but risky.  I have thrown people off my ranges for clearing a gun in that manner.  Clearing a gun, the shooter must have attention to what they are doing and avoid diverted attention.  Ejecting a live round and attempting to catch it, the shooter\u2019s attention is diverted away from the gun and trying to track and catch something relatively harmless.\r\n\r\nCupping:  Again, a dangerous practice.  The risk to the shooter is the circumstance that the round fails to eject from the port and the primer comes in contact with the ejector, causing an out of battery discharge of the round.  Injurious to the shooter and damage to property. \r\n\r\nI subscribe to the philosophy that any administrative handling of firearms should support the combative manipulations.  No manual of arms that I have been taught for reloading or malfunction clearance calls for the shooter to cover the ejection port and/or retain the case.  \r\n\r\nPoint in safe direction.  Remove the source of ammunition.   Support hand to the rear of the slide, attempting to rip it off the gun, ejecting any rounds or brass.  Locking the slide to the rear, visually and physically inspecting chamber and breech-face.  Empty and clear with no Hollywood or risk to self and others.\r\n"}

A .177\" pellet (the most common kind), weighs about 10 grains (7000 grains to the pound; 10 grains is 0.65 grams).  You can expect a pellet to leave the muzzle of an air pistol in the neighbourhood of dgm's 400fps figure.\r\n\r\nBy \".22\" you probably mean a .22 rimfire.  This cartridge has a 40 grain bullet, which fired from a pistol will have about 1000fps muzzle velocity (from a rifle you'll get about 1250fps).\r\n\r\nAs you can see the .22 is much more powerful - its bullet is four times as heavy as the pellet, and it is moving 2.5 times as quickly.  This gives it 25 times as much kinetic energy as the pellet.\r\n\r\nAt 10ft, a pellet will embed itself a well into a 3/4\" thick softwood board but won't penetrate.  It will easily embed itself in flesh and it would destroy an eye.\r\n\r\nAt 10ft, the bullet from a .22 will completely penetrate several 3/4\" thick software boards and is easily capable of producing a lethal wound.\r\n"}

The longer the barrel, the more \"shake\" there will be to it as the bullet leaves.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, heavy barrels can have weight (and rigidity, given the same overall diameter) removed while increasing surface area (for greater cooling) with the aid of flutes. Fluting a barrel also has its own set of tradeoffs that are expertly explained in an  article titled <a href=\"http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/RealBenefitsBarrelFluting.asp\"><em>The Real Benefits of Barrel Fluting</em></a>."}

Every professional LE/Mil trainer I know teaches it. This is for a reason: it's an outstanding stance to use for firing a pistol. Also has the benefit of placing your armor plates perpendicular to the target, providing a wider area or coverage than a plate that is angled, and giving you a better chance to stop incoming rounds.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BrhCi9WZCEk/TPqj5TRglGI/AAAAAAAAADo/YVvuPhWr1q8/s1600/Costa2_600.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Costa firing in the modern isosceles stance\" />\r\n\r\n##Execution\r\n\r\n - Shooter shifts their weight forward and stands more on the balls of their feet.\r\n - Upper back and shoulders roll forward\r\n - Shooter's arms are in line with their shoulders\r\n - Shooter's head is more forward than in the traditional Isosceles\r\n - Shooter must relax their shoulders to help in recoil absorption\r\n\r\n##Benefits:\r\n\r\n - Creates a strong support to help control recoil\r\n - With the head forward, balance is further shifted forward, and the shooter is given a clearer view of the sights in relationship to the target.\r\n - Solves the \"problem\" of muzzle flip associated with the Isosceles Stance. \r\n - Simpler than the push/pull dynamic of a proper Weaver Stance\r\n\r\n#Weaver\r\n<em>Kickin' it old-school.</em><br />Weaver was developed by Deputy Sheriff Jack Weaver in the late 1950s. The intended purpose is to create isometric tension which should lessen and help to control recoil. This stance is definitely old, and has been dropped in favor of the isosceles for race guns and the modern isosceles for fighting guns.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.thesunblog.com/frosting/jackbauer8.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Bauer in the weaver stance\" />\r\n\r\n##Execution\r\n\r\n - Shooter's strong-side elbow is straight, but not locked\r\n - Shooter's support-side elbow is bent straight down\r\n - Shooter pushes forward with the strong-side hand, pulls with the support-side hand\r\n\r\n##Negatives\r\n\r\n - Shooter must maintain the push/pull to manage recoil, which will tire them more quickly\r\n - Shooter presents a target on the oblique, which if wearing armor presents the unprotected, or \"soft\" areas of the sides and shoulders\r\n - Shooters lose range-of-motion when transition to targets on their support side, as their feet are offset and their body is already turned\r\n - Shooters must move their entire body to engage targets on their support side\r\n - Shooters with differing dominant hand/dominant eye will never find a comfortable shooting position: you will either have to adjust the position of the gun to one side if you put the proper arm forward, or you will have to shoot with your strong side in support to line up with your dominant eye\r\n\r\n#Chapman or Modified Weaver\r\nIdentical to the Weaver but with one important difference: in Modified Weaver, the shooter locks their strong-side arm strait.\r\n\r\n"}

In general, be gentle with their merchandise. You don't need to use kid gloves, but don't let the slide slam back into battery, do NOT use a wrist flick to close the cylinder on a revolver, and don't let magazines just drop to the ground unless you've asked or been told it is ok. Finally, be polite. \r\n\r\nHere are a few specifics to get you started:\r\n\r\n - When handed a gun, verify it is unloaded, then close the action gently while asking the counter guy for a safe direction for you to point the gun. Keep to that safe direction. Do NOT sweep the counter guy or anyone else.\r\n - Ask about dry firing before doing it. Some places really hate this. \r\n - Ask about field stripping. I think this would be be weird for a new firearm, but probably not for a used one.\r\n - If you can hand it back in a way that makes it easy to verify it's unloaded (cylinder swung out or slide locked back), do so. Follow their lead as far as putting back on the counter. If he holds out a hand, hand it to him.\r\n - You probably won't be able to shoot a new gun, I've also never run into a shop that'll let you shoot a used gun, however some shops will let you quickly rent and shoot an identical model, then apply the rental price towards a purchase if you make one.\r\n - Don't argue. Don't go looking to prove you're smarter, better, more tacticool. If you ask their opinion, accept it. If they offer an opinion you didn't ask for, nod and smile. Even if you're convinced they are wrong, you don't need to correct them, just don't give them your business. If they are doing anything or encouraging anything you consider dangerous, leave.\r\n - If you see another customer doing something dangerous (like sweeping the muzzle around the entire store) tell your counter person. You can say something to the other customer directly or not, that's up to you. If the employees look at you like you're being silly, leave.\r\n - Don't surprise them. If you are currently carrying, don't suddenly present your own firearm. Yes, I saw someone start to do this once.\r\n\r\n"}

You can build a PVC frame and make a net bag to fit inside it to catch brass.  (Don't use cloth or it will be a sail and blow over all the time).  Fine for stationary shooting.\r\n 3. You can get a tool like the [Brass Wizard][1] (also sold as the \"Nut Wizard\" - it was originally designed for picking up nuts.  Works great except in rock.\r\n 4. Bring along a friend that's a reloader.

Depending on the type of steel your springs are made of and the environment you're shooting in, spring steel rusting may not be an issue. In the desert southwest and the middle east I've never had a problem with this. Very fine sand and grit, however, has been an issue for me repeatedly. \r\n\r\nTo clean my mags I generally do not disassemble. I put them under running water and blow them dry, and if it's available I use compressed air to blow them out and skip the water (rust isn't really an issue for me). The tolerances in most magazines I've used are not nearly so tight that they require constant or very thorough cleaning.\r\n\r\nI generally perform this whenever I feel that the follower is riding roughly through the magazine body. I check the mags each time I clean my firearms, and generally only have to clean them every third or fourth time. Under very bad conditions, such as training or working in the rain and mud, or in sand storms, this interval obviously increases."}

Most magazines (like those for an XD) will work almost indefinitely without cleaning if they are used exclusively at the range, and your range isn't located in a dust bowl.  If you drop them (as in action shooting sports) you should clean them any time they get dusty / muddy / wet and at least once a season.  Probably the most harsh environment for a magazine is concealed carry.  Lint and other debris accumulate in both firearm and magazine and I'd recommend cleaning such a mag every other month or so.  \r\n\r\nThese are pretty general guidelines.  Single stack magazines seem immune to all kinds of debris, higher capacity magazines less so.  But most standard capacity magazines are going to be pretty robust."}

While your body type may challenge you, look at the whole system of carrying:\r\n\r\n - Gun:  Get a normal sized gun (yes, I consider a G21 normal sized) that you are comfortable carrying and are proficient with.  I can't see why you can't conceal a G21.\r\n\r\n - Holster:  A good quality kydex, leather or hybrid inside the waistband holster.  With less waistline, you may want a slight cant (FBI cant of 10 to 20 degrees) of the holster to bring the grip slightly forward on your body as to avoid the \"grip print.\"  A high rise style holster may help conceal a bit by bringing the grip higher above the belt line.  But, it may be a little slower to draw due to having to bring the hand higher to acquire the final firing grip.  \r\n\r\n - Belt:  A belt designed specifically to carry the weight of a gun and support equipment.\r\n\r\n - Clothes:  Fit to carry a gun IWB and baggy enough to break up the print of a handgun on your waist.  If you want to wear tight jeans and a ribbed tshirts, they won't go well concealing a G21.  Avoid solid light colors and look for patterns that will break up the print. "}

For me, it's more comfortable than inside the waistband, though opinions differ. I wear my holster behind my hip (4:30-5 o'clock), with a pretty serious forward cant.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty here is that you have to wear shirts that come down past the bottom of the holster and won't rise up past it. If you live in a state that allows concealed carry but not open carry (like Texas, off the top of my head), you'll want to be especially careful about this, because they consider open carrying 'brandishing'. You'll also want shirts that are a little baggy, to hide the 'grip print' Ray J mentioned. For me, it's an excuse to wear button-up shirts, which I think look nice anyway.\r\n\r\nNo matter where you carry, it's absolutely critical to practice drawing it until it's second nature. You don't want to have to draw and get caught up on your clothing."}

I actually won't use any lubricant/penetrating cleaner from the firing pin face, all the way to the rear of the gun, only rubbing alcohol. I also use separate brushes for oil and non-oil work.\r\n\r\nField strip it like the manual shows you and clean the barrel like you would any other gun,\r\nstick with nylon brushes. I like to use Ballistol here, scrub the barrel once, 1-2 wet patches, and run dry patches (1-2) until clean.\r\n\r\nScrub the mag well and everything to the rear of the locking lug block using your alcohol only brush. I like to use shredded micro fiber rags and wrap my brush while I do this. While holding the slide with the firing pin facing down, scrub the firing pin face and the extractor claw,(You want it facing down so no grit falls back into the firing pin channel.\r\n) then lay flat and use same brush to clean rear of slide around trigger safety plunger etc. \r\n\r\nFor the front of the slide, I use an \"oil only\" brush with rag lightly soaked in Ballistol to get at all the areas and then buff them down with a shop cloth or some other general purpose rag.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to actually lubricating the slide. You need to make up your mind on what you want to use for lubricants. You can't buy that goo glock distributes with their new guns so I take it all off with rubbing alcohol and then replace it with TW25. Then I just clean the frame rails with lightly soaked Ballistol (penetrating lubricant and cleaner) rags and reapply TW25 as needed to the slide rail channels. TW25 doesn't run either so you can easily apply it to the trigger bar like the manual says and it won't run down into your frame. A drop of that in the locking block area is good too.\r\n\r\nThat's really it, any other lubrication point is optional, some people like to put a little grease on the top side of the barrel. It's really up to you. \r\n  \r\nqtips are great for detail work, so are pipe cleaners albeit a little more expensive. The later bits are necessary though when you break down the rear of the slide and service the striker channel and other spring loaded channels. NO LUBRICANT THERE, the plastic and the metal finish is sufficient. Do that about once a year or 5000 rounds, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nIf you still need a hand getting through the basic field stripping/re-assembly process. See hickok45's youtube videos on glock cleaning."}

People shoot .22 because (among other reasons) it's inexpensive.  The cheapest brands (Remington bulk boxes come to mind) will unfailingly have about 1% duds.  \r\n\r\nMagazines are probably the second biggest issue.  Being a rimmed cartridge it's harder to make a quality magazine for a .22.  Ruger has done quite well, and some of the 1911 conversions (TacSol and Marvel) have also made very reliable magazines.  Many aftermarket magazines do not perform well.  If you're using multiple magazines, number them and take note of the mag in use whenever there's a malfunction.\r\n\r\nDirt.  The .22 is a dirty round.  A bit less so when you use the quality stuff, but it's still much messier than any centerfire ammunition.  .22's often run best pretty dry, to prevent accumulation of debris.  When the Akins Accelerator was still being sold (a full-auto mechanism) the manufacturer recommended a teflon-based dry lube (Liquid Wrench, etc. - available in home stores).  \r\n\r\nFinally, there's the firearm in question.  If you don't have 500 rounds through it, don't do anything (other than cleaning and light lube) until you reach that mark.  After that you might take a piece of crocus cloth and polish up any of the areas where you see wear.  This should smooth things out considerably, and was a necessary step to get one of my Ceiner .22 conversions to work.  \r\n\r\nIf none of that fixes the problem, send it back."}

Just coat the inside of the barrel with the CLP, wait a few seconds, then run the snake through it a few times. If you've got really tough fouling, use some heavier solvent and a brass bore brush then follow up with the clp and snake.\r\n\r\nI don't like to use CLP on any other part of the 1911. I prefer to just use a penetrating oil that can build up over time. This means a bit more elbow grease trying to get the grime off, but that's acceptable. I'll talk about lubrication in a second.\r\n\r\nWipe down the outside of the barrel with a cloth that won't leave lint. I actually really like those microfiber cloths that you use to clean monitors (see if you can pick some up in a bargain bin at an electronics store).\r\n\r\nOn the slide, pay close attention to the rails and the space under the hook of the extractor. Scrub the rails with a soft gun brush - not a brass one - and use a cotton swab to pull out the loosened carbon. Be sure to inspect closely for any loose strands of cotton. Use the brush to make sure there is no carbon built up under the extractor. Any other buildup should be clear to the naked eye and easy to clean out.\r\n\r\nOn the frame, focus again on the other set of rails and use the same method described above. Don't forget the feed ramp! Anything else, again, should be pretty plain to see.\r\n\r\nBe sure not to ignore the recoil spring. Inspect it and wipe off any gunk you find.\r\n\r\nFor lubricant, I like to use MILITEC-1. It will build up in the metal over time and makes the action of the 1911 smooth as glass whether you run it wet or dry. Set the slide straight up on a flat surface, apply a drop of MILITEC to the back of each rail and let it drip down. Apply a moderate amount of oil to the barrel and work it over the whole surface with your fingers. Don't let any of this oil find its way into the bore! You shouldn't leave an excess of oil on the surface of the barrel, but I like to keep it a little wet. Use a small amount of oil on the spring and work it over.\r\n\r\nOn Series 80 1911s, there's a small \"nub\" on the frame just forward of the hammer that's a part of the firing pin block. Push down on it and slowly let the spring push it back up. If its movement feels grainy or sticky, put a small drop of oil on it and work it up and down until it moves smoothly.\r\n\r\nIf the slide stop was difficult to extract, apply a tiny amount of oil to that.\r\n\r\nThat's everything off the top of my head. You usually won't *need* to detail strip a 1911, but it can't hurt to do it a few times throughout the life of the gun. I'll let someone more familiar with the process describe that part."}

The 1911 is an easy gun to detail strip and while the described cleaning protocol works well for 90+% of the gun's needs, there are times a detail strip is a good idea:\r\n\r\n 1. Use of dirty ammo\r\n 2. Dirty environment\r\n\r\nThose two conditions will result in fouling in places that you can't reach in the normal cleaning and it is a good idea to strip it all the way down to clean and inspect the small parts at times.  When I lived in the southwest (Las Vegas) desert and spent a vast majority of the time shooting outdoors, the fine dust and sand always found its way into the nooks and crannies of my guns.  My rule of thumb is that any time I changed springs (recoil, firing pin and to a lesser frequency, the mainspring) I detail stripped it and did a thorough cleaning.  A good guide that shows how to detail strip a 1911:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.m1911.org/stripin1.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

I picked up a Sig 1911-22 several months ago\r\nand have been less than impressed with the reliability. I take good\r\ncare of it and use Ballistol and TW25 to clean and lubricate the firearm.\r\n\r\nAfter about 50 rounds it starts to jam big time. Fails to cycle,\r\nfails to eject, you name it. Recently the guide rod snapped while\r\nfiring, locked up so bad I sent it back to Sig to fix it. I couldn't\r\neven take it apart.\r\n\r\nI've been shooting mostly Fiocchi and some CCI, jacketed. It was\r\nbroken in with HV rounds, yellow jackets, per the sales guy recommendation.\r\n\r\nMy question is are these levels of reliability normal for this\r\nplatform? Is there an ammo type/velocity I should be using to avoid\r\nthese problems? I'm ready to give up and trade this in for a 22LR revolver.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n***Update 01/24/2012***\r\nFinally received the 1911-22 back from Sig and the guts of the gun have\r\nbeen replaced. An *upgraded recoil guide rod and barrel bushing*, along with\r\na ***new barrel***.\r\n\r\nIt's the last part that bugs me as the gunsmith went on to say that he\r\ndiscovered \"gas cutting\" in the chamber which was likely the result of using\r\n.22 cal \"short\" ammo. This implies that I was shooting the wrong loads which\r\nis completely false. I guess it's impossible that the throat tolerances on\r\nthe bore were off to begin with, that would mean QA failed.\r\n\r\nWe'll take it out to the range soon and see how it does."}

Find a US Vendor who is selling the firearm you want to buy... can be either a business or a private individual or a US auction site like GunBroker.com... arrange a tentative purchase... and tell your US Vendor that you will be using Questar International as your \"US FFL Transfer Dealer\".  That is the key phrase... this way they won't be worried about export issues or the fact that you are a Canadian... since we are a US FFL holder your vendor is simply doing a regular domestic sale and shipping to another US dealer.  (The process is the same for parts and accessories... fees change slightly - see #3 below).\r\n   2.  Use our on-line 3rd Party Purchase Order Form to supply us with the information required to do your paperwork and handle your import/export for you...\r\n          *  Answer all of the questions and include detailed info...otherwise your permit may be delayed or denied;\r\n          *  Your current PAL is mandatory... we do NOT do business with anyone who does not have a PAL;\r\n          *  Details about the firearm(s) being imported (make, model, serial number, type of gun {shotgun, semi-auto pistol, revolver, bolt rifle, etc.}, caliber, barrel length, US Purchase Price, etc.)\r\n          *  Name, address, e-mail, phone # and fax # for the current U.S. owner/seller;\r\n          *  If firearm will not be \"stored\" at your home address then we'll need the storage address for CFC...  (your storage address CANNOT be a P.O. Box - CFC won't accept that);\r\n          *  CFC wants a \"stated purpose\" for the firearm (\"hunting\" or \"collecting\" or \"target/competition shooting\");\r\n          *  For Non-Restricted firearms CFC requires that we enter your Place of Birth to do the on-line transfer;\r\n          *  For \"Restricted\" firearms CFC requires that we give them the name of your \"Gun Club\" the Club Membership Number and/or your LT-ATT#;\r\n          *  We will require that you scan and email or fax to us an \"End User/Purchaser Statement\" (use the link to download) leave the IIC # blank and complete the rest. We can't process your export permit without this document;\r\n   3.  Finalize payment of the applicable Import Service Fee;\r\n   4.  Questar will fax / e-mail a copy of our U.S. FFL (Federal Firearms License) to your U.S. seller.  The address of our US office is on the FFL we send them and it is that info that US law requires them to use... they can't ship based on verbal directions... they legally can only ship to the address shown on the FFL we send them;\r\n   5.  You pay your US Seller for the firearm and arrange for them to ship (prepaid) the firearm to the address on our U.S. Federal Firearms License.  (If you want delivery confirmation then please arrange with your US Vendor to send you the tracking data... this can easily be done at time of shipment... we do not give progress reports).\r\n   6.  We apply for your IIC (International Import Certificate).  Ottawa is currently taking 1 to 5 weeks to approve IIC applications...  there is no real average timeframe.\r\n   7.  We then compile all of the paperwork, transfer it to our US office and your US Export Permit application is then submitted to US State Department for approval... It usually takes 6 to 10 weeks for them to review and approve the application...  (about 8 to 12 weeks for the overall process);\r\n   8.  Once all required permits are approved and received we then arrange to transport the firearm(s) to Canada and clear the shipment through Canada Customs (you will be responsible for payment of any duty and/or taxes levied by Canada Customs on your imports).\r\n   9.  We will then verify and register your firearm(s) into the CFC database.\r\n  10.  Firearm Marking Requirements legislation has been postponed until December 1st 2009\r\n  11.  We'll send you a Disbursements Invoice for any duty, taxes and final shipping costs applicable on your imported firearm... when payment has been received, we will arrange for the firearm to be transferred to your name.\r\n  12.  We will then arrange final shipment of the firearm to you.  Please be aware that Canada Post now requires that ALL FIREARMS be shipped via Expedited Parcel, adult signature required, no safe drop.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:  It is impossible for us to give customers step by step updates on the \"progress\" of their import.  Many customers call or email us asking \"has my gun arrived yet at your US office\" or \"has my export permit been approved yet\" or \"when will my gun get here\" or \"is it here yet\"?  While we understand that you're just anxious and excited, we need you to understand that it's physically and economically impossible for us to answer those questions. \r\n\r\nAt any given time we're handling 50 to 100 customer importations and we simply don't have the staff to answer everyone's constant inquiries.  It's like kids in the car asking \"Are we there yet?\"... only in our car there are over 100 kids asking us.\r\n\r\nIf you want to track the arrival of your purchase to our US office then ask your Vendor to insure that the shipment has tracking details (or delivery confirmation) and that he sends you copies of the tracking info on the shipment, that way you'll know that it did arrive at our office and when. \r\n\r\nOnce the export paperwork is approved we'll schedule transport across the border and we will contact you when your gun arrives in Canada and is being entered into the CFC database... at that time you'll be sent your Disbursements Invoice and final arrangements for transfer and shipment will be made.  Until then please understand that we simply don't have the personnel to supply progress reports.\r\n\r\nYour understanding and co-operation is greatly appreciated."}

In terms of handgun ammunition, the most common measure I've seen to distinguish the relative efficacy of one cartridge versus another is knock-down power, which is a product of the muzzle energy, external, and terminal ballistics.  Given that 357 SIG and 357 Mag use the same diameter bullets (indeed, they can use the *exact same* bullets), for the sake of argument we can ignore the questions of external and terminal ballistics and focus just on muzzle energy.\r\n\r\nMuzzle energy is a computation taking into account the weight of the bullet and the speed at which it's travelling when it leaves the muzzle.  I went to CheaperThanDirt.com and looked up the muzzle energy values for the top six most popular loads in each caliber. The average muzzle energy for the two cartridges: 357 SIG is **501.23 ft-lbs**, 357 Mag loads is **469.56 ft-lbs**.  \r\n\r\nAgain, this is a reflection of what are the most popular items sold at CheaperThanDirt.com right now (and customer preferences can certainly change).  The greater case capacity of the 357 magnum certainly makes it possible to load it to shoot with more muzzle energy than a 357 SIG, but that doesn't mean that one can make a the general statement that one is ballistically superior to the other."}

You have a couple questions here, and many implied questions as well.\r\n\r\n**The Lower Receiver & Kit:**\r\n\r\nLets start with the \"kit\".  What kind is it?  Where did you order it from (links would be good)?  Typically, when you build an AR, you look at an upper receiver and lower receiver.  You will need a lower parts kit (sometimes called an LPK).  It contains the small components that fit into the trigger assembly and lower receiver (Safety, etc), and you will **definitely** need it.  Here is one from a reputable seller online:\r\n\r\nhttp://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/palmetto-state-armory-gen-2-moe-lpk.html\r\n![LPK from Palmetto State Armory retailer][1]\r\n\r\nThat covers most of the Lower Receiver.  I'm glossing over a lot here, but the basics hold.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n**The Upper Receiver:**\r\n\r\nFamiliarize yourself with the Bolt Carrier Group and upper receiver portions of your AR.  AR's come in two variants:  Piston-driven and Direct Impingement (sometimes called \"DI\").  Essentially, the two differ in how to handle the hot gas that your gun uses when it discharges a cartridge.  Without complicating things further in this thread, here is a quick and short video showing how the two operate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7GTZ0DixqA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sort of information (knowing your Lower, Upper, LPK and DI or Piston) are sort of the basics you'll need to know at some point.  The most common AR build is chambered in 5.56/.223 Rem.  I've seen some that are 7.62/.308 Win as well.  Your's is likely .223 or 5.56.\r\n\r\nBefore you even consider firing a round in the rifle, **make sure you know the gun inside and out** (you'll have to know most of it, since you'll be assembling it).  Not all uppers can fire 5.56 NATO cartridges when they are stamped .223 Remington.  This is due to the pressure differences the rifle will undergo on a 5.56 NATO cartridge vs the .223 Remington round.  However, if your rifle is stamped for 5.56 you can shoot any .223 and not have to worry.  I could go off on a tangent about the Throat leade in a .223 vs 5.56 rifle, but I'll refer you to this article first: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2677734/posts \r\n\r\nSuffice to say, stick with whatever ammunition your upper tells you to use.  Read the manual :-).\r\n\r\nFinally, I learned most of what I know by browsing the forums of a well respected gun-community called CalGuns (http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/index.php).  There are tons of \"how tos\" posted there, as well as deep information on ARs, components, parts, etc.  I'll plug them here since they've been a positive force in the gun ownership community, and taught me basically everything I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend building an AR from scratch if this is your first gun.  Don't get me wrong, they're great rifles and work well when properly maintained, but to have never owned a gun and jump into it by building an AR might be a bit overwhelming, and you do not want to make mistakes.  If you can, friend a local gun shop (buy your ammo from them or any accessories, the AR is the barbie doll of the gun world, with a million and one useless accessories ;-)).  Friend the gun shop, then go in and discuss your AR, questions you have, etc.  If it's a good shop, they'll help you out because they realize you'll be in later to buy items for it.\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps, and congratulations on becoming a gun owner!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wQ0OU.jpg"}

If you must obscure an eye, try to work toward being able to shoot with both eyes open.  \r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you know which of your eyes is dominant.  It's possible that you \"can't\" close an eye because you're trying to close your dominant eye.  There are several tests you can try, and which one works best seem to vary with person, so rather than suggest one, I'll let you [google it][1].\r\n\r\nOnce you are using your dominant eye to aim, if you need to obscure your non-dominant eye, start with an eyepatch.  (These are available at most pharmacies and where eyeglasses are sold for a couple of dollars).  Try to progress to a piece of black tape on the lens of your shooting glasses (non-dominant side only, of course) and then a piece of scotch tape.  \r\n\r\nOne thing you will find, particularly when using iron sights is that a small change to the angle at which you hold your head can make a significant difference.  Play with the idea, but don't rush it - it comes with repetition more than experimentation.\r\n\r\nOnce you can remove the scotch tape and shoot with both eyes open you are at your best for shooting (and photography).  The vision in your dominant eye will be at its most acute.  \r\n\r\nWhen one eye is closed there is strain in the muscles that focus the eye and the open eye dilates to collect more light.  Of course you also lose some depth perception - all of which are detrimental.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.com/search?q=finding%20eye%20dominance"}

Chief among them is cost.  The cost of lead-free ammo is substantially more than that of lead based ammo.  This alone, and chiefly has delayed widespread adoption of lead-free bullets.\r\n\r\n\"Extensive\" is an ambiguous term, but I have used several types of lead-free bullet and there are certainly differences in performance.  On the plus side, lead-free solids achieve greater penetration and are capable of excellent accuracy.  Being constructed from homogenous material, they do not suffer inconsistencies in center of gravity as jacketed or multi-material bullets may.  On the other hand lead is a difficult metal to compete with, for density and malleability (both important, especially for hunting bullets) and most alternate materials are not as heavy (has negative impact on accuracy potential) and will not expand and retain mass as well, which is important in achieving best terminal performance - \"stopping power\").  \r\n\r\nA final issue (in the US) is our ridiculous ban on \"armor piercing ammunition\".  This ban (which declares bullets to be \"armor piercing\" if they contain the wrong materials and can be used in a pistol) prevent a lot of solutions from coming to market.  Barnes recently had to withdraw a series of banded solid (non-lead) bullets that the ATF determined were in violation of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Some people claim (erroneously, in my opinion) that the peening action of the beads will prevent a finish from taking, but that's never been a problem for me with anodizing, parkerizing, or bluing.  \r\n\r\nThere's not a lot to sandblasting \"technique\" other than to be patient and get an even blasted finish.  Much like spray painting something with a rattle can, it's consistent, overlapping strokes that result in an overall consistent beaded finish.\r\n\r\nI would not sandblast any plastic or wood parts without understanding the effect of the blasting.  It will erode both materials pretty rapidly.  I would also avoid sandblasting the barrel crown or chamber.  The parts you absolutely should not sandblast are your sear surfaces - this is the only instance I can think of that is a matter of safety.  Other trigger components will generally be unimproved by blasting as they function best with a smooth finish.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're able to completely remove the 'sand' from anything you've blasted.  Parts with deep recesses and interlocking holes require careful attention.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are considerations for particular firearms, but examples elude me at the moment."}

To quote Arizona wildlife biologist Gerry Perry:\r\n\r\n\"As one can deduce condors are susceptible to a variety of types of mortality, and simply pointing out lead related deaths further demonstrates the politically motivated angle that anti-hunting groups have on their agenda -- ban lead ammunition.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mr. Perry's comments on the subject can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nssf.org/factsheets/AZletter.cfm "}

Learn to shoot on your dominant eye side, rather than your dominant hand side.  A very valuable skill to possess and practice. \r\n\r\n2. Shoot dominant hand side, but aim with your dominant eye.  Easy enough to do, providing your grip incorporates a slight cant of the gun to bring the sights to your dominant eye focal plane.\r\n\r\n3. Shoot dominant hand side and aim with non-dominant eye.  A little tougher, as your dominant eye wants to take over.  Instead of blinking/squinting or closing your \u201cother\u201d eye, use the bridge of your nose to block your dominant eye by turning your head ever so slightly.  Slightly blocking your dominant eye with the bridge of your nose will bring your non dominant eye to the sights much more naturally.\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t close one eye.  If you are ever planning on training to use a handgun defensively, you need to learn to shoot both eyes open and frankly, use and practice all three options above.  Good luck!\r\n"}

In the event that you are accosted and need to fire from retention, there will be no sights on target.  Similarly, if the target is very close, you may not need, or use, the sights.  At any time prior to deciding to shoot, and maneuvering the firearm on to target - the finger stays out of the trigger guard.  When your firearm is not yet pointed at the target, your finger should be completely off the trigger.  This will not cost you time, but it may help prevent a premature discharge which could injure an innocent or at the very least, delay your placing hits where they need to go."}

I'll take a first stab.\r\n\r\nEvery cartridge has a proper name that includes more than just the caliber. The name \"9mm NATO\" means more than a 9mm caliber (aka bullet diameter) bullet. The proper name implies various important dimensions of the entire cartridge like overall length, case length, neck diameter, and maximum pressures during firing. A firearm designed to fire 9mm NATO will be designed around all these specifications. So, if you're looking to buy ammunition for a particular firearm, check to see what the firearm is designed for and match that name exactly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is are a lot of similar terms for the same cartridge and also similar sounding terms for different cartridges. Here's my list:\r\n\r\n - **9x19mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19mm, 9mm long.** This is one of the most common handgun cartridges on the planet. When talking about handguns, if someone says \"a 9mm\", he probably means this. But it's always wise to be specific before loading \"a 9\" cartridge into a \"a 9\" handgun. \r\n\r\n - **9mm NATO.** Nearly identical to the 9x19 Parabellum, but the spec allows for a bit more pressure. Before firing, be sure a given gun is designed for 9mm NATO and not just 9mm Luger.\r\n\r\n - **9mm Kurz, 9mm Short. .380 ACP, .380 Auto, 9x17mm, 9mm Browning Short.** A completely different handgun cartridge often used by smaller \"pocket\" guns. \r\n\r\n\r\n - **9mm Browning Long, 9x20mm.** A rare (I don't think anyone produces this ammunition commercially or even guns to fire it) handgun cartridge. I listed here simply to differentiate from the use of \"9mm Long\" above and to again drive home the point about being particular before trying to chamber and fire any given cartridge in a given firearm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are dozens of other cartridges for rifles, revolvers, and pistols that have 9mm in the name, [Wikipedia][1] can help you here. Or maybe I should make this a community wiki answer and have other people contribute to the list?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_mm_caliber"}

Depending on what you're doing each of these might make sense.\r\n\r\nCaliber: is how most cartridge collectors organize their cartridges due to disputes in the other methodologies.\r\n\r\nVelocity: is important to most shooters, but perhaps a key scale to target shooters who aren't concerned with terminal performance.  (Of course they're also concerned with the bullets ballistic coefficient...)\r\n\r\nMomentum: is a scale to those in the 'mass is most important in terminal ballistics' school of thought.\r\n\r\nEnergy: is the scale to the 'shock effect' school of thought in terminal ballistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome principle rifle cartridges in the US in quasi-ranking of power:  (velocities listed are representative, but differing loads and bullet weights will go either way).\r\n\r\n1. 22 LR - rimfire, small bullet, low (~ 1200 fps) velocity\r\n2. 30-30 - a .30 cal bullet, still lower velocity.  An old black-powder cartridge it's name means a 30 caliber bullet propelled by 30 grains of black powder.\r\n3. .223 - our common military small bore, high velocity cartridge.  Pretty high energy, particularly for a tiny bullet. velocities ~3000 fps varying with bullet weight.\r\n4. .308 - our former small arms weapon caliber, and a popular hunting round good for most, if not all, North American big game.  A .30 caliber bullet at velocities of ~2600 fps. Very comparable to the less common .300 Savage.\r\n5. .30-06 (The name meaning .30 caliber developed in 1906).  Another old military cartridge.  Uses a longer, heavier action than the .308 with only small gains in velocity.  Think .30 bullet at ~2800 fps.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of cartridges that have been based on the venerable '06 (pronounced \"ought six\").\r\n7. .45-70 Another old black-powder cartridge meaning a .45 caliber bullet with 70 grains of black powder, this is a big beast and commonly associated with the old buffalo hunters.  A modern sibling is the 450 Marlin.  It launches a very heavy, large slug at pretty good velocities (~1800 fps).  \r\n8. .458 Winchester Another big bore, probably the most common heavy game (think Africa) cartridge that's frequently seen in the US.  A thumper to be sure.\r\n9. .50 BMG - a scaled up (1.667x) version of the .30-06, originally designed for heavy machine guns (and still used for such) but now popular for long range target shooting.\r\n\r\nThere are necessarily many omissions in the above list (including some popular foreign calibers like the 7.62x39 and 7.62x54R) and again, the velocities listed are for comparison you can find examples of higher velocities in any of those calibers."}

A good example of ammunition that is \u201cmost likely to fail\u201d is Winchester White Box (WWB). This rare failure is too low a percentage to make an issue, however it is one we are well aware of. The fix to resolve this issue is quite simple:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Clean and lube your slide and barrel.</li>\r\n<li>Shoot 1 mag to 1 box of good quality +P or +P+ ammunition through the barrel.</li>\r\n<li>Try the FTF ammunition again. If it runs... great!  If you experience more failures you will have a couple choices to make:</li>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Reduce the recoil spring weight to 11 lbs. Cost is about $25 for stainless steel guide rod and reduced power spring.</li>\r\n<li>Shoot 124 gr or a better quality 115 gr ammunition exclusively. The FTF 115 gr ammunition you are currently using is no longer a valid option.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhat causes this problem? Several issues come into play:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The 40 slide and (40 conversion) barrel are thicker than standard 9mm slides and barrels. This extra thickness equates to more weight. The combined extra weight taps the energy of the \"weak 115 gr ammunition\u201d to its complete demise. It simply lacks in power and fails to reliably eject the spent round.</li>\r\n<li>Every once in awhile a Failure To Feed/Failure To Eject (FTF/FTE) is caused by a fit issue. We resolve fit issues by pumping +P or +P+ ammunition through the gun. This hot ammunition provides extra pressure and the pressure will positively align any and all components. Once they are all aligned there is no longer a fit issue. The FTF/FTE is usually resolved.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n \r\nFYI: Several manufactures are currently producing low powered 115 gr 9mm loads. This ammunition is also known to produce failures in all standard model Glock 9mm pistols.\r\n</blockquote>"}

I'll take a first stab.\r\n\r\nEvery cartridge has a proper name that includes more than just the caliber. The name \"9mm NATO\" means more than a 9mm caliber (aka bullet diameter) bullet. The proper name implies various important dimensions of the entire cartridge like overall length, case length, neck diameter, and maximum pressures during firing. A firearm designed to fire 9mm NATO will be designed around all these specifications. So, if you're looking to buy ammunition for a particular firearm, check to see what the firearm is designed for and match that name exactly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is are a lot of similar terms for the same cartridge and also similar sounding terms for different cartridges. Here's my list:\r\n\r\n - **9x19mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19mm, 9mm long.** This is one of the most common handgun cartridges on the planet. When talking about handguns, if someone says \"a 9mm\", he probably means this. But it's always wise to be specific before loading \"a 9\" cartridge into a \"a 9\" handgun. \r\n\r\n - **9mm NATO.** Nearly identical to the 9x19 Parabellum, but the spec allows for a bit more pressure. Before firing, be sure a given gun is designed for 9mm NATO and not just 9mm Luger.\r\n\r\n - **9mm Kurz, 9mm Short. .380 ACP, .380 Auto, 9x17mm, 9mm Browning Short.** A completely different handgun cartridge often used by smaller \"pocket\" guns. \r\n\r\n\r\n - **9mm Browning Long, 9x20mm.** A rare (I don't think anyone produces this ammunition commercially or even guns to fire it) handgun cartridge. I listed here simply to differentiate from the use of \"9mm Long\" above and to again drive home the point about being particular before trying to chamber and fire any given cartridge in a given firearm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are dozens of other cartridges for rifles, revolvers, and pistols that have 9mm in the name, [Wikipedia][1] can help you here. I mad this a community wiki answer so other people contribute to the list?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_mm_caliber"}

If I remember correctly, they are a necked down version of that round. This caliber used for various types of large game from Antelopes and Sheep to Mule Deer and Moose. I have personally used it for Antelope, and White-Tail (As well as decided it was not the best round for prairie dogs). \r\n\r\n.243 rounds are a necked down version of .308 caliber rounds. The round is often used, in the US, for Deer hunting as it is the minimum caliber allowed and is widely available. Due to the high muzzle velocities it has less drop than many other common rounds, but from personal experience is affected by cross winds more. \r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, 45-70's are really fun to target shoot!

The answer is in the math, look at the chanber specifications and you'll figure it out. The question I have to ask you is, what are you going to use it for? If your going to use U.S commercially available ammo and are looking for the most accuracy then the wylde chamber may be for you. If not, then the 5.56 NATO chamber is probably the easiest to live with. I hope to be testing a wylde chambered DI gun against a 5.56 DI and 5.56 piston in the near future to shake out the wheat from the chaff.

A reticle design you like.  It may be simple crosshairs or have some features for helping you lead a moving target, determine range, or compensate for range.\r\n\r\n2. Magnification.  For 2-300 yards I wouldn't go above 4x unless you're strictly bench shooting.  (Because of #3)\r\n\r\n3. Field of view.  The downside to higher magnification is that you can see less in the scope, so you can concentrate really hard on that big, well-magnified 'X' and put a perfect shot onto your neighbor's target, because you couldn't see the target number.  Similarly you can get a field of fur and not know what part of an animal the crosshairs are on.\r\n\r\n4. Clarity.  You just have to look through the scope and see how clear the image is.  Pay attention to what the image looks like close to the edge of the scope - that's where poor optics will let you down.\r\n\r\n5. Light gathering.  If you have a chance, compare some optics at dusk or dawn.  One of the things that separates really good optics from other contenders is their ability to make the most of very little light.\r\n\r\n6. Adjustments.  If you plan to shoot close to long range (both) target style adjustment knobs as well as fine (`1/4MOA) adjustments are nice.  For 100-300 yards 1/2MOA is fine.  (If you want fine adjustment buy a nicer scope - less expensive scopes that have fine adjustment frequently do not track consistently).\r\n\r\n7. Brand.  I know brand really isn't a feature, but it is a sort of guarantee.  The name brands are guaranteed to be acceptable quality.  A lot of 'budget' makers have entered the market in recent years and they can be hit or miss at best.  \r\n\r\n8. Adjustment precision.  Here's one you probably won't get to try until you've decided.  If you want to evaluate how well a scope's adjustments work you can shoot a 'box' - shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope 3 MOA right, shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope 3 MOA down, shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope  3 MOA left, shoot a 3-shot group.  Adjust your scope 3 MOA up and shoot a final 3-shot group.  A perfect scope (and competent shooter) should have a six-shot group and a perfect square made by the other 3-shot groups.  It's normally the 3rd and 4th groups that stray in a poor scope."}

It is quite straightforward to shoot a .223 out to 600 yards/metres and get results good enough to enjoy the shooting.  And with the right preparation and planning (mostly in the choice of barrel twist rate, and the bullet used), one can shoot a .223 out to 1000 yards, in competition, and get results good enough to win regional or national rife matches.\r\n\r\nMost of my shooting is done on rifle ranges so this answer will be based on the kind of shooting that I do most (firing prone, with the rifle supported either by a rest/bipod or by a shooting jacket and sling, at 300 500 600 900 and 1000 yards).  I have done a bit of standing shooting too but I find that my rifle moves around much more that way ;-)\r\n\r\nFor target shooting, with a well-supported rifle, more magnification always seems to be welcome (I've used 20X and 24X scopes and I've always wanted more; some of the top shooters these days are using 42X scopes).  I find that magnification needed/desired does not change with range - if the style of shooting (well-rested prone shooting, in my case) finds that 30X is useful at 600 yards, it'll also find 30X to be just as useful at 100yards (e.g. testing ammo) or at 1000 yards.  If you want to shoot standing, or other sorts of \"field\" shooting, you will benefit from having a lower power scope or a variable power scope.  As Gene mentioned there is a direct field-of-view vs. magnification tradeoff to be made.  I have shot at 800 yards with a 4X scope and things look so small you can't figure how it is that you are able to hit the target every time (but you can!).\r\n\r\nFor target shooting, most shooters seem to choose very fine reticles, to allow them greater precision in aiming.  A very fine dot, or very fine crosshair, are some of the more common choices.  Myself I prefer very heavy reticles, even when using very high magnification scopes for high precision target shooting (I find that a thick reticle is always easily visible, and even if the reticle is substantially larger than the size of the area you wish to place your bullets in, you can nevertheless aim to a much finer degree than the size of your reticle).\r\n\r\nBoth of the rifles you are considering are good choices.  Of the two I would choose the Tikka, they are one of the best out of the box factory rifles.  Not that you asked me but there are also some very good rifles made by Savage too (especially if you are looking for a factory rifle capable of competitively shooting 1000y).\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know this, most provinces have Provincial Rifle Associations which enjoy free access to DND (military) ranges and offer very nice outdoor shooting programs from May to September every year, with shooting from 300y to 600y (and in some places to 1000y).  If you're interested in that sort of thing, let me know what province you're in and I can send you some more info.\r\n"}

An IER scope has an extended range over which the target appears in focus compared to a standard scope.  This makes presentation (bringing the scope to the line of sight) a bit less critical.  Combined with the location on the rifle, which lets the eye track the scope into place better and you can snap the rifle into your shoulder and onto target faster than with a conventional scope.  \r\n\r\nAn additional advantage (at least to hunters who carry their rifles any distance) is that it moves the scope forward of the point at which the rifle balances, allowing the user to grasp the rifle at the point of balance - the most natural way to carry it for extended periods.\r\n\r\nIER designs are not well suited to high magnification.  This isn't much of a disadvantage as that's not what they were designed for.  Another 'disadvantage' that really isn't inherent in the scope itself is just that many rifles do not have a means of mounting such a scope in the proper location.  Only a few commercial variants exist, then there are gunsmith-installed adapters (like the 'ching ring') to retrofit other popular designs."}

This cartridge is an A10 designed Automatic Rifle Cartridge is Also Known As 308 Winchester for non military chamber rifles with 100 to 220 grain weight bullets available. NATO is military specification for pressure, powder, and bullet design for defense.  The 300aac blackout is a .308 Diameter bullet in a 5.56/223 CASE that is cut down, shouldered to 35mm Length,Case Neck formed to fit the chambe's shoulder thus a 7.63x35mm CARTRIDGE. A .308 bullet diameter to pass through a .300 rifle bore that accomidates the rifling grove diameter to allow the bullet to pass through.  Light bullets need a SLOW twist like 1:12 for 50 graine an lighter bullets in the 5.56/223. 30 caliber bullets use 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, to stabilize heavy bullets 150 to 220 grain weights @3000FPS & 11:1, 12:1 for lighter weight bullet stabilzation. Any bullet can be fired in any twist BUT ACCURACY MAY FAIL!!\r\nThe 300AACBlkOut is a 30 caliber bullett in a 5.56/223 case! The AR is primarliy a short range hard hittingMax Penetration SubSonic Designed for low Sound Supression in short barrels. & can be shot SUPERsonic for tough Game at short ranges Like BigBoarHogs! You cant puta 7.62 NATO roud in a 300AACblkOut Chamber PERIOD! If this doesnt make sense to you then DFWI!"}

I did do some research on the Internet combined with some intuition. It's much more common to see folding stocks than pistol-grip only stocks and I reasoned that if a folding stock worked so would a pistol-grip only stock. As your question indicated, the problem is usually whether or not there is a buffer tube or spring tube in the OEM stock that would prevent you from putting something like a pistol-grip only stock on. To figure this out, you can search for \"folding stock Remington 11-87\". Or, the owner's manuals often have an exploded parts diagram that will clearly show a spring tube if it exists and those owner's manuals are often available online from the manufacturer. \r\n\r\nSome examples: \r\nFor the Rem 11-87/1100. http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx had this image in the manual. The part labeled `7` is an `Action Spring Tube`\r\n\r\n![Rem 1100 parts diagram][1]\r\n\r\nFor the Mossberg 930, http://www.mossberg.com/content.asp?ID=520&section=service has a manual with a similar image also showing a spring tube extending into the OEM stock that probably prevents using a pistol-grip only stock.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/VzFzc.png"}

With these places, you'll may  hear \"once it hits the floor, it belongs to us\". Don't argue with the range. If you don't like their policy, don't give them your business. Some of those ranges will bend the rules for their regular customers. So once you get to know folks there or if you see others collecting brass, you might try asking again. At other ranges, you are expected to clean up after yourself (this is often called \"policing your brass\") this includes taking brass home or putting it in their containers. \r\n\r\nAssuming the range allows you to pick up brass, the other part of this is picking up brass from other shooters.  **It is rude to pick up someone else's brass without asking** or until it's clear it has been discarded (that shooter has left).

I'm going to try to leave my opinion out, and rather than tell you what brand / model to buy, tell you what to look for.\r\n\r\n1. The first, and very most important, feature of a handgun is you want one with a competent operator.  That's you.  Whether you spend $400 or $4000 on a pistol, you are not adequately prepared to use it in self defense until you've had a great deal of practice and / or training.  To paraphrase a quote by the (I think) Jeff Cooper: \"Having a handgun doesn't make you armed any more than having a piano prepares you to play a concerto\".  Do not make light of this requirement.\r\n\r\n2. Fit your 'stopping power' theory.  Some people think bigger bullets are more effective, others believe higher velocity is more important.  Because of #1, being able to afford ammo is a serious concern.  I'd suggest avoiding expensive 'exotic' calibers and stick with the common (and relatively inexpensive) calibers: 9mm, .40, .45.\r\n\r\n3. Find a pistol that fits your hand.  First make sure you're holding it correctly - a lot of people grasp a handgun so that it recoils against their thumb, rather than into their palm.  Make sure the barrel lines up with your forearm when you hold the pistol, and pick something that's comfortable to hold that way.\r\n\r\n4. See that you can reach the controls.  Ideally you can hit the magazine release (on an auto) or the slide stop without moving your strong hand.  (This isn't always possible, just work as close to this ideal as you can).  You shouldn't have to strain to perform routine operations.\r\n\r\n5. Get a brand name.  Even with a name brand there's no guarantee, but if you find a no-name deal, it's likely to be problematic.  Glock, Kimber, Springfield, S&W, Sig, etc. all make reliable firearms (and the occasional dud).  \r\n\r\nI hope that's enough to get you started.  Some pistols you may want to look at:\r\n\r\nRuger GP100 revolver,\r\nKimber or Springfield 1911,\r\nGlock in small, medium, and large frame (see what fits *you*),\r\nS&W M&P,\r\nSpringfield XD,\r\nSig Sauer in caliber of your choice.\r\n"}

Having a sight mounted \"far off\" the bore axis is OK, though there are a few quirks:\r\n\r\n - it can be a bit slow or awkward to shoot, since you'll end up with little or even no support for your cheek.  (The \"Delta HBAR\" model from a long time ago, before the days of \"flattops\" being common, added a special cheek support to compensate for this; arguably it looks a bit goofy/klugey. \r\n - At close range (less than 100 yards, but in particular at distances less than 20 yards), you will notice the effects of the bullet starting off several inches away from your sightline.\r\n\r\nTo expand on the last point a bit.  If your sightline is three inches above your boreline and you are zeroed at 100 yards, when you shoot at 50 yards you'll find the bullet to be about 1.5\" below your aiming point; when you shoot at 20 yards you'll find the bullet to be about two and a half inches below your aiming point.  The most \"interesting\" situation of all is when you set up a chronograph 3 yards in front of you and carefully set things up so that you don't shoot your chrono - if you forget that at extreme close range your bullet is actually 3\" lower than your line of sight, you might end up putting a bullet through your chrono even though your sight picture showed that you were going to clear it.\r\n"}

MP40 (which is 9mm Luger) doesn't have the power of bigger rifle cartridges (not to mention it's inaccuracy on longer distances).

Oftentimes excellent results can be had from non-firearms-specific lubrication products.\r\n\r\nThere are several different types of lubricant needed, depending on the purpose/requirement of the joint/surface of the firearm in consideration.  For example, the bolt lugs of a rifle need to have lubricant that stays in place even in the face of high pressure sliding/wiping contact.  A pretty ordinary grease does a good job of this, whereas a high tech high performance oil might not stay there after several dozen (or hundreds) of cycles - it's not that the high tech gun oil is a poor lube, it's just that it doesn't fit that particular application well.

I believe it retails for $529 but any typical gun shop will sell it for less. I paid $420. Also in terms of ammo 9mm is not a bad route to take. A second option would be slightly above your listed price range, but a great choice if you want something with a little more stopping power. It's the [Ruger SR1911 .45][2] which I absolutely love.

Lead has been used for a long time because of how cheap it is, it is easy to work with, the density and softness of the metal. The attributes of lead have allowed for the development of expanding bullets (due to lead deforming at high velocities on impact) and heavy bullets for penetration. Heavy weight lead bullets allow for penetration despite the fact that the bullet is losing mass due to fragmentation while passing through an animal (generally lead bullets lose ~15-30% of their weight). Non-lead bullets on the other hand expand due to specific manufacturing and are designed to perform exactly the same every time and extremely unlikely to fragment. \r\n\r\nNon-lead bullets are made of copper or guilding metal, and are therefore less dense than lead. This does not mean a reduction in performance however. Non-lead bullets tend to hold 98-100% of their weight and expand to approximately 2x diameter. They put about the same foot/lbs of energy into a deer sized ballistic gelatin block at 100 yards. In all non-lead bullets tend to perform the way that bonded lead core bullets are manufactured to and actually do it better. The idea that non-lead rifle bullets will damage barrels is not accurate as they are made of metals that are used to jacket lead core bullets. Impacts on the barrels are for all intents and purposes identical. \r\n\r\nThere are several things to consider when switching to non-lead. The first is that because they are less dense bullets of the same weight will be slightly longer. Therefore, to maintain accuracy it is often a good idea to actually move to a lighter non-lead bullet as it will match the twist rate more like a heavier lead bullet. If shooting light skinned game lighter bullets with a polymer tip will help to drive expansion even more. Also, shifting a little bit farther into the shoulder as the point of aim will increase expansion.  \r\n\r\nHaving tested numerous types of lead and non-lead bullets in ballistic gelatin, water barrel tests and in hunting situations, I am convinced that non-lead bullets are a technology that far surpasses what is capable with lead. Lead worked for many years due to reasons I talked about earlier, but with expanding monolithic non-lead bullets they have created bullets that will out-perform the old standbys. Everything that is required for a hunting bullet is there. Deep penetration, great expansion, and high accuracy with the added bonus of not leaving fragments of lead behind in gut piles or worrying about finding it in the game meat you are eating.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the testing we have done, available non-lead bullets, some pricing comparisons and lots of articles check out www.huntingwithnonlead.org."}

If you're someone that always buys the most expensive ammunition available, you're not going to see a big difference in price. Based on his data, steel ranges from 7% more to 7% less depending on caliber. It's the other end where you see the big differences, as shown in this graph created from the same data:\r\n\r\n![price comparison graph][1]\r\n\r\nIf you're someone who always buys the *cheapest* ammo you can find (which is a lot more like me--and, I suspect, most of us) the switch to unleaded ammo will cost you an extra 71% on average. For .223 it's only a 16% difference, but all other calibers see an increase of over 50%, topping out at 114% for 30-30.\r\n\r\nThen there's the matter of availability. There's a red bar missing from the chart because between four major brands at two retailers there was no steel 45-70 ammo offered. In many other categories there was only one non-lead offering, so the selection of non-lead ammunition seems to be limited.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNDk7.png"}

I actually won't use any lubricant/penetrating cleaner from the firing pin face, all the way to the rear of the gun, only rubbing alcohol. I also use separate brushes for oil and non-oil work.\r\n\r\nField strip it like the manual shows you and clean the barrel like you would any other gun,\r\nstick with nylon brushes. I like to use Ballistol here, scrub the barrel once, 1-2 wet patches, and run dry patches (1-2) until clean.\r\n\r\nScrub the mag well and everything to the rear of the locking lug block using your alcohol only brush. I like to use shredded micro fiber rags and wrap my brush while I do this. While holding the slide with the firing pin facing down, scrub the firing pin face and the extractor claw,(You want it facing down so no grit falls back into the firing pin channel.\r\n) then lay flat and use same brush to clean rear of slide around trigger safety plunger etc. \r\n\r\nFor the front of the slide, I use an \"oil only\" brush with rag lightly soaked in Ballistol to get at all the areas and then buff them down with a shop cloth or some other general purpose rag.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to actually lubricating the slide. You need to make up your mind on what you want to use for lubricants. You can't buy that goo **[1]** glock distributes with their new guns so I take it all off with rubbing alcohol and then replace it with TW25. Then I just clean the frame rails with lightly soaked Ballistol (penetrating lubricant and cleaner) rags and reapply TW25 as needed to the slide rail channels. TW25 doesn't run either so you can easily apply it to the trigger bar like the manual says and it won't run down into your frame. A drop of that in the locking block area is good too.\r\n\r\nThat's really it, any other lubrication point is optional, some people like to put a little grease on the top side of the barrel. It's really up to you. \r\n  \r\nqtips are great for detail work, so are pipe cleaners albeit a little more expensive. The later bits are necessary though when you break down the rear of the slide and service the striker channel and other spring loaded channels. NO LUBRICANT THERE, the plastic and the metal finish is sufficient. Do that about once a year or 5000 rounds, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nIf you still need a hand getting through the basic field stripping/re-assembly process. See hickok45's youtube videos on glock cleaning.\r\n\r\n**Update 3/29/2012**\r\n\r\n1. I've learned since that this is copper anti-seize grease who's primary purpose is to ensure the slide can break free from the rest after the gun has been sitting in a warehouse for who knows how long. There may be a use case where the operator seldom fires their pistol to maintain the anti-seize grease in addition to regular lubrication. Having lots of firearms and not enough time to give them all a turn is also a good argument to maintain the anti-seize or some other grease layer on the slide."}

Don't go wandering around the house with or without a light, trying to find the intruder.  Don't try to \"clear\" your house.

Ammunition capacity is pretty clear - all else being equal, more rounds are better. There is also weight - bigger grips and magazines with more rounds lead to a heavier loaded weight, which may be a concern.\r\n\r\nGrip size and shape is an issue as well. Grip size can affect concealability, but I think that a good fit to the shooter's hand is more important. It's possible for a person of any hand size to hold and fire a pistol of any grip size, but accuracy and recoil control are much better when the barrel axis is lined up with the arm bones of the shooter when the gun is held in a firing grip. This may not be possible if the grip is too large or small for the shooter's hand.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have relatively small hands, and I cannot get a really good grip like this on many double-stack pistols with mainsprings in the grip, such as the Beretta 92 series, especially when I also need to be able to reach the long, heavy double-action trigger. On the other hand, I know several shooters with large hands who prefer these larger-gripped pistols. Caliber is a factor too - double-stack 45-caliber pistols have even larger grips than double-stack 9mms."}

(Google 'cratex' and you can find smaller kits or individual pieces).\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend disassembly regardless of how you do it - you won't have to worry about touching the slide or frame or getting 'grit' in your pistol.  Removing the thumb safety is relatively simple:\r\n\r\n1. Take the slide / barrel assembly off the frame just as you would for cleaning.\r\n\r\n2. Ease the hammer forward to relieve pressure from the mainspring.\r\n\r\n3. With a punch, drive out the mainspring pin (the pin at the bottom rear of the butt).\r\n\r\n4. Slide the mainspring housing down and out of the pistol.\r\n\r\n5. If the 3-fingered spring falls out at this point, don't worry about it.  It will fall out by the time you've removed the safety.\r\n\r\n6. Put the hammer in the cocked position.\r\n\r\n7. Starting with the thumb safety in the 'fire' position, start pulling the safety out while raising it toward the 'safe' position.  A little bit before it gets all the way to normal 'safe'position it should start to pull out.  This might take a bit of fussing to find the first time.\r\n\r\n8. As the safety comes out, it frees the plunger in the plunger tube.  It's unlikely to fly away, but watch it.\r\n\r\n9.  Withdraw the safety completely.  If it's an ambidextrous safety the passenger side is removed by rotating it so its 'tail' clears the grip scale.\r\n\r\n10. At this point the grip safety will fall out (along with the 3-fingered spring if it hasn't already).\r\n\r\n---Go do your work on the safety.  \r\n\r\nRe-assembly is just following the directions in reverse with the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. Start by placing the 3-fingered spring in position.  The bottom should engage the slot in the bottom back of the frame. \r\n\r\n2. Push the mainspring part way in place to hold the 3-finger spring in place for the rest of the process.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the hammer position ('cocked' when inserting the thumb safety, 'fired' when re-installing the mainspring).  Use a 1/16\" punch to depress the thumb safety plunger while pushing the thumb safety home.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/METAL-FINISHING-CRATEX-ASSORTMENT-PIECES/dp/B000HQICXE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1334632727&sr=8-7"}

But that is their decision to make, not mine.\r\n\r\nDon't ever forget _your own goal_ when handling a weapon: your own safety and the safety of those who you are charged with protecting. Hurting aggressors is the method, not the goal. Much more often than not, scaring them is just as effective a method as hurting them, and it is safer for yourself and for those around you.\r\n\r\nLast thing: know your weapon. Whenever you get a new firearm, \"fire\" it without any rounds to feel where the trigger release is. Be able to put 90% of firing pressure on the trigger without firing it. Your finger will thus learn the weapon, and you will be safer and in better control both with the finger on the trigger and off of it. Your rounds will find their target better, too, especially on the range and at night.\r\n\r\n[1] White lie as now my thumb is broken and I have to open the safety with my left hand."}

One guy I know puts impact-resistant glasses over his prescription glasses, he uses the same type of impact-resistant glasses as one would use while drilling.\r\n\r\nI personally think that the use of special protection glasses while shooting is foolish. One is generally shooting for one of three reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. To familiarize himself with the weapon and to zero it.\r\n 2. To perform an aggression (such as an arrest).\r\n 3. To perform a defense.\r\n\r\nObviously the most critical of these reasons is the third, and in that scenario you will be lucky to have the time to properly place your ear protection on, much less eye protection. So get used to the conditions under which your will be shooting under the third reason, even when you are shooting for one of the other two.\r\n\r\nAnd _always_ wear ear protection."}

Brass and other cuprous alloys are much harder to melt and the equipment to do so is outside of what most people would find reasonable for bullet manufacturing.  Tungsten 'inserts' would be illegal to manufacture in pistol ammo.\r\n\r\nAny type of insert poses an additional complication as well and that is maintaining a concentric center-of-gravity.  At best the bullet will precess resulting in high drag and a low ballistic coefficient.  At worse it may not even be able to stabilize.\r\n\r\nIf you have those issues handled, keeping the 'inserts' on a metal tray attached to the melting pot should heat them sufficiently, but you may have the opposite problem - that the bullets take longer to cool.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of bullets with multiple materials is normally done by swaging, which cold-forms the malleable metals under terrific pressure.  The center-of-gravity issue would likely be handled by first swaging the soft (lead) core with an imprint (hole) for the insert.  The insert would be placed in the hole, capped with a jacket blank and then swaged to final form.  "}

Twenty twos are cheap, easy and fun to shoot.  All of the important basics can be acquired and honed with a .22 without having to contend with significant recoil (the less fun part) or a .45 inch sized hole in your foot (the much less fun part). Move next to the 9mm and last to the .45.  I love my .45 cal Kimber.  I love to fire my 9mm Glock after a few rounds with the .45.  After the .45, the Glock feels like a .22 and is so controllable and accurate.  The suggestion of buying a .22 conversion kit is a good one.  I have one for my 9mm and use it to practice trigger control, marksmanship and to keep my wife involved in shooting.  Find a range that rents guns and shoot as many types and calibers as it takes to make you comfortable enough to make your decision.  And...have fun!\r\n"}

Training does work in the opposite direction: people trained on centerfire pistols do fine with a .22."}
