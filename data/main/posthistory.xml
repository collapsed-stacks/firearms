As the bullet flies (on a shot with ~0 elevation change), 100% of gravity's effect on the bullet is going to be &quot;downward&quot; as the sights are concerned, i.e. 90 degrees away from the shooter. In a significantly downward or upward shot, a good portion of gravity's effect is going to be back toward (when shooting up) or away from (when shooting down) the shooter, as opposed to &quot;down&quot;.

The most important factor is that you can fire the gun comfortably and accurately. The best way to find this is to try firing several types of guns - some ranges will rent various models of guns to you to try, and some have classes where you can try several different types of guns. Your local gun clubs may also be able to help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next factor is to get effective ammunition for the weapon. Effective ammunition is generally available in calibers 9mm and up. Bigger calibers may be more effective, but have more recoil, which can make you shoot more slowly and less accurately. Also remember that common calibers, like 9mm and 45ACP generally have cheaper practice ammunition available. You should use JHP for personal defense for reasons best covered in another question. Speer Gold Dot and Winchester Ranger are generally considered good brands of JHP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for types of weapon, semi-autos are more effective because they hold more ammunition and are easier to reload, however, you need to practice more to know how to load and unload them. If you know you won't be able to practice a lot, a revolver is a good choice because it is easy to see if it is loaded or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind also that any bullet powerful enough to reliably stop an attacker is also powerful enough to penetrate several walls and cause serious injury to anyone on the other side.

You can either take it to a gunsmith and have him work on the stock parts or on custom made parts, or get a kit with all the parts you need. The most popular kit in the communities of people who run their guns very very hard is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid35.html&quot;&gt;Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit by Apex&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The APEX Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit (DCAEK) was designed to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; provide the M&amp;P (9 mm, .357 Sig &amp; .40 only) pistol owner a smooth,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consistent 5 - 5.5 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter&#xD;&#xA;&gt; over-travel and reduced reset.  The kit includes:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - APEX Hard Sear (9 mm, .357 Sig &amp; .40 series) - NOT FOR .45 ACP APEX&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - M&amp;P Ultimate Striker Block Kit (USB kit) APEX M&amp;P Increased Rate Sear&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Spring &amp; Trigger Return Spring (aluminum slave pin included)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As they say on the site in the detailed description, this will not change the pre-load on the trigger, also called up-take or pre-travel. Apex makes a kit that will change these but recommends it for only competition use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another product available from Apex is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid44.html&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt;. From their site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (Patent Pending) is a drop in part&#xD;&#xA;&gt; engineered to improve tactile trigger reset of your M&amp;P pistol.  Along&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with improving the felt reset, the Apex RAM also serves as a failsafe&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the unlikely event of a Trigger Return Spring breakage; keeping the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; trigger bar properly positioned under the sear and allowing the user&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to manually manipulate the trigger forward between shots.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Just treat the metal to prevent further rusting and carry on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many treatments such as Duracoat and Cerakote that will allow you to recover metal parts of a firearm. You can apply these as needed and they are easier to deal with than rebluing or reanodizing metal parts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you truly want to restore the original finish of a firearm with bluing, you can find gunsmiths who will do this for you. It is a labor-intensive process, and can be quite expensive. The coating mentioned earlier can be applied by you in your home, and even the bake-on ones can be baked on in your own kitchen oven. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the site of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahlmans.com/metalfinishing.html&quot;&gt;a gunsmith&lt;/a&gt; who does rebluing: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Rebluing is more than restoring the color of your gun.  It is a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; complete overhaul.  We start by completely disassembling the gun. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then the gun is buffed completely to remove any scratches or rust pits&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and restoring all corners and edges to &quot;factory new&quot; sharpness.  Then&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it is polished to a bright luster for better appearance.  The gun is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then boiled in a special solution which removes every trace of dirt,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and blued to a deep black color.  Finally we reassemble and function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; test the gun.  The result is a gun which in most cases looks &quot;better&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than new&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all gunsmiths may take the pride in their work that this particular one does. They may not do the polishing prior to bluing, or the resharpening of edges to remove signs of wear. And if you're not worried about a new-gun look that may be fine. But be aware that truly restoring the bluing to a firearm is an intensive process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally have had anodized parts that needed machining (AR15 lowers), and after machining I simply covered them with duracoat and they've had no issues. It may be that these will be the easiest way to restore the appearance and protection to the metal." />

If you are trying to become a great long-distance marksman, that will be a totally different course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would initially avoid any classes that focus too much on &quot;tactical&quot; issues. Get the basics first. Safe handling and storage, legal issues in your locale and basic shooting proficiency. Any class that does not include a range component should be avoided, because it is simply not practical.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you plan to acquire concealed carry permits, it may be important depending on where you live, to take a particular kind of course with a particular kind of certificate at the end. Many states require proof of proficiency, which you can sometimes provide with such a certificate. This is a highly localized thing, so you will have to research that independently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an NRA member, I am biased towards taking classes from them. My first training class was run by a local shooting range, and provided a training certificate at the end. The course covered all the basics of firearms safety, as well as components on the use of deadly force, anatomy of different kinds of firearms, etc. The course included several nights of classroom instruction, and three days at the range.

You can't keeps kids away from everything dangerous in life all the time, some exposure is needed at some point to something as common as a gun (that is if you want them to be comfortable with them). Educate them as early as possible whenever they hit an age that you feel they are capable of absorbing safety information and realizing just how dangerous guns can be when handled improperly. Some kids should never be around guns regardless of education, but most kids I've ever been around have enough mental and emotional stability that they would have no problem with them as long as they have the proper education and supervision. Lack of education is the single greatest contributor to firearm accidents with children (and a lot of adults!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, a quick-access safe like a GunVault (or something similar with a better reputation) would be your best option for storing a home-defense handgun.

Make sure it's unloaded and always, always watch your muzzle direction!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Get the cylinder swung open, removed or whatever else it takes to get to a point where you see the back of the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;External once-over - look for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Boogered screws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Cracks: pay particular attention to the back of the barrel and the frame where the barrels goes in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Proper fit at any place there's metal-to-metal edges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Look under the &quot;topstrap&quot; just over the barrel for signs of flame-cutting.  A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate&#xD;&#xA;wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small &quot;heat shield&quot; has gone missing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, esp. near the muzzle. Look for signs of&#xD;&#xA;cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Look at the cylinder's &quot;star&quot; at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is &quot;full lockup&quot; - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barre) - that's endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is&#xD;&#xA;OK, esp. with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (esp.&#xD;&#xA;aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it's a scary thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check for &quot;rotational wiggle&quot;.  A little is OK on S&amp;Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.&#xD;&#xA;Umm...except for those crazy Matebas and Rhinos, I have no clue on those :).  On double-action Colt revolvers there's&#xD;&#xA;supposed to be zero rotational play.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  UNLOAD it.&#xD;&#xA;You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a &quot;circle behind a circle&quot;&#xD;&#xA;effect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the &quot;loose rotational lockup&quot; guns (S&amp;W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's&#xD;&#xA;possible to &quot;nudge&quot; the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is&#xD;&#xA;minimal, .003&quot; to .004&quot; optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006&quot; I'd be&#xD;&#xA;unhappy with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's&#xD;&#xA;next &quot;click&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer&#xD;&#xA;bar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light&#xD;&#xA;sideways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger &quot;transfer bar pinch&quot; issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc." />

You could use a bench or a rest of some sort, or go crazy and get something like a [Ransom Rest][1]. Assuming you are adjusting fixed pistol sights that are in a dovetail, you will also need some sort of sight adjustment tool to move the rear sight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Fire several rounds from your stable position. This is your baseline.&#xD;&#xA; 2. If the shots landed to the left of where you were aiming, move either the rear sight to the right or the front sight to the left. If the shots landed to the right of where you were aiming, move either the rear sight to the left or the front sight to the right.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Fire another shot or two to see the results of step 2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, you should only move the rear sight, not the front. Also, it isn't easy to change elevation (shots landing above of below point-of-aim) on a pistol with fixed sights. It is possible, but often involves changing out parts or filling in the dovetail under the sights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ransomrest.com/RansomRest.html" />

For ammunition that you must rely on, if you have chambered a round once and have to remove it from the chamber, throw it away.&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the AR15 platform, the floating firing pin inside the bolt will repeatedly strike the primer of the round. 5.56mm ammunition uses hard primers so that the light strikes from the firing pin do not cause problems. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problems arises when the primer is lightly struck repeatedly. The primers will be more and more prone to failure with each strike, even after a very small number of chamberings. The LAPD SWAT department had two documented issues with this, one a misfire during a raid and one when they went to the range to fire the rest of their ammunition in an attempt to diagnose the problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are not depending on this ammunition to do your job or save your life (home defense, police, military, hunting, etc.) then you are fine with taking the chance of a misfire. For shooting at the range and just for fun there is no issue with rechambering rounds repeatedly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Repeated chamberings also carry the risk of bullet setback, where the bullet is pushed farther back inside the casing. This can cause various problems and should definitely be avoided. If the bullet is lose or you can see a gap between the edge of the casing and the side of the bullet, toss it. The bullet setback is a bigger deal than the primer strikes. " />

I try to teach them to pretend that the gun could just go off at any time and to assume they're loaded.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I was 12, I took a hunter's safety education course in Washington state.

There were some stupid ass kids there, pointing it at people, etc. etc. I was the only one to point it in a safe direction.

If you were to have a round in the chamber and smack the hammer hard enough, the gun will fire from this decocked state. One notable exception to this is the older &quot;Series 70&quot; style 1911s that have no firing pin safety: even with the thumb safety engaged if you drop them on their hammers they can and have fired.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of decocking a handgun is to do one of two things: first, to put the first trigger pull of a single- and double-action (SA/DA) weapon into double action mode; second, to put a single-action-only (SAO) pistol into a non-operable state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pistols like most standard Sigs have no thumb safeties, and carrying them chambered and cocked is considered unsafe. Having them decocked with a very heavy initial trigger pull is considered to be the proper way to carry a pistol of this type. Pistols like most HKs (with their non-DAO trigger packs) support both thumb safeties for cocked-and-locked (loaded, chambered, cocked, and on safe) carry and use, being on safe and decocked, or being decocked and on fire.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pistols that are double-action-only (DAO) can not have a decocker, as they are never cocked except when halfway through their firing cycle (pulling the trigger will both cock and fire the gun, returning it to a decocked state — in this way, perhaps the trigger could be considered the decocker)." />

If not, it is a rear sight cover issue. Then push the aperture back and forth sideways - if it has significant movement, the aperture is loose in the sight base. There is a tool made to peen the side of the base right in line with the tracks for the aperture to take up that slack. I think Brownells carries it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A new sight cover runs about $7. Check the gears and fit to the track and make sure everything is nicely greased while you're in there.

No company or model is immune. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are using something like a 1911 — any 1911 — it is wise to go through a much more thorough initial evaluation. The tuning and attention these require are for serious shooters if the gun is to be used in a defensive capacity. Small changes to small parts can have dramatic effects on the reliability of a given ammunition. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Most professional trainers and hard shooters recommend at least 1000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/strong&gt; (training classes, heavy drills at the range, inclement weather, high heat, and little cleaning but proper lubrication).

The reason you hear of the help in accuracy is because if you&#xD;&#xA;    chamber barrel with a reamer that has a dull throater instead of cutting&#xD;&#xA;    clean sharp rifling it smears a burr up on the down wind side of the&#xD;&#xA;    rifling.  It takes from 1 to 2 hundred rounds to burn this bur out and&#xD;&#xA;    the rifle to settle down and shoot its best.  Any one who chambers rifle&#xD;&#xA;    barrels has tolerances on how dull to let the reamer get and factories&#xD;&#xA;    let them go longer than any competent smithe would.  Another tidbit to&#xD;&#xA;    consider, Take a 300Win Mag. that has a life expectancy of 1000 rounds. &#xD;&#xA;    Use 10% of it up with your break in procedure for ever 10 barrels the&#xD;&#xA;    barrel maker makes he has to make one more just to take care of the&#xD;&#xA;    break in. no wonder barrel makers like to see this.  Now when you flame&#xD;&#xA;    me on this please include what you think is happening to the inside of&#xD;&#xA;    your barrel during the break in that is helping you.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Gale McMillan&#xD;&#xA;    NBSRA IBS,FCSA and NRA Life Member&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yet on the websites of various other barrel makers, we find long and elaborate procedures for breaking in barrels, claiming to have the benefit of easier cleaning, greater accuracy, and improved barrel life. From barrel maker &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lilja Precision&lt;/a&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We recommend that your new Lilja rifle barrel be properly broken-in to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; obtain the best accuracy. A proper break-in will help ensure that your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; barrel will clean easily in the future and that you will achieve&#xD;&#xA;&gt; maximum accuracy potential. Please follow these important&#xD;&#xA;&gt; instructions.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; We are concerned with two types of fouling: copper fouling, which is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; caused by bullet jacket material being left in the barrel, and powder&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fouling. During the first few rounds a lot of copper fouling will be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; left in the barrel. It is important to remove this fouling completely,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; after each shot, to help prevent a build-up later on. Powder fouling&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is ongoing, but easy to remove. Do not use moly-coated bullets during&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the break-in procedure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And again from Krieger Barrels we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kriegerbarrels.com/Break_In__Cleaning-c1246-wp2558.htm&quot;&gt;a third story&lt;/a&gt; regarding not the bore, but the throat (left as an exercise for the reader).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what's the answer to the question of barrel break-in? Is it true, or false? Wisdom for the ages, or merely a common myth perpetuated by superstition-run-rampant? " />

The failed round&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from the potential OIS incident had a primer strike of only .013&quot;—the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; minimum firing pin indent for ignition is .017&quot;. In addition, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; primers on the other rounds were discovered to have been damaged from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; repeated chambering. When the same cartridge is repeatedly chambered&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the AR15, the floating firing pin lightly taps the primer; with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; repeated taps, the primer compound gets crushed, resulting in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inadequate ignition characteristics--despite what appears to be a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; normal firing pin impression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.m4carbine.net/showthread.php?t=19881&quot;&gt;5.56mm Duty Loads&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Gary Roberts (aka DocGKR)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not specific to platforms with a floating firing pin, repeated chamberings also carry the risk of bullet setback, where the bullet is pushed farther back inside the casing. This can cause various problems and should definitely be avoided. If the bullet is lose or you can see a gap between the edge of the casing and the side of the bullet, toss it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If you are not depending on this ammunition to do your job or save your life (home defense, police, military, hunting, etc.) then you are fine with taking the chance of a misfire. For shooting at the range and just for fun there is no issue with rechambering rounds repeatedly.**" />

Human beings are not meant to have a small explosion go off in their hand.  When we're forced to do so, we tend to want to get it over with as quickly as possible, hence the jerk.  Unfortunately, all that extra pull on the trigger throws off our point of aim (usually low and to the left for a right-handed shooter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way to avoid jerking the trigger is to use what is called the surprise break.  In the surprise break we press the trigger slowly to the rear so that we don't know the exact moment it's going to go off.  That way we don't have a chance to jerk or flinch until the shot has already left the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several techniques to combat trigger jerk and help you achieve a surprise break.  First, do lots of dry fire practice (working the gun's trigger without any ammunition in the gun).  Concentrate on pressing the trigger straight back, slowly increasing the pressure until it breaks and the gun goes off.  Second is the ball and dummy drill.  Get some dummy rounds in your caliber (also called snap caps) and load a magazine with a mixture of live ammunition and dummy rounds.  It's best if you get someone else to load the magazine, but if you're at the range by yourself you can load several magazines and randomly select one.  The idea is that you won't know whether the round in the chamber is a live one or a dummy.  If you jerk the trigger on a dummy round, it will be obvious because the barrel dips down when the striker falls.  Keep racticing these drills and you can beat that trigger jerking problem." />

You take it out day one and you can't even FIND where you're shooting. It certainly isn't the target. How many squirrels must die before you learn how to aim it at the proper place? That's ok, squirrels are tasty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Zeroing a rifle is when you center the rifle's point of aim exactly on the either the crosshairs of the scope or your center of the point of aim on your sights. Basically, if you pull the trigger, does the bullet land exactly where your crosshairs were pointing? If not, your gun is NOT zeroed!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So how do I zero my rifle?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you shoot your rifle at a target. You have NO idea where it landed. What do you do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First. Bore sight. When you shoot your rifle in an open field at a target you will see NOTHING unless you got it on the target. What if you never got it on the target? Not your fault, but guns are NOT accurate right out of the box. The bullet will land wherever the barrel or BORE is pointing, not counting trajectory. The problem is how do you know where your BORE is pointing? Your scope is supposed to tell you that. It first needs to be calibrated. That is what 'zero'ing your rifle really is. It's calibrating your scope to your rifle. Now, in our scenario we are shooting in an open field against a target that has the sky as a backdrop. You cannot see where your bullets are landing because they're not on target. Therefore, you have no way of knowing if your bullets are too high, low, left, or right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What if you could look down the bore of your rifle *AND* look through the scope at the same time. That would make it SUPER easy to see if they lined up. Too bad our eyes aren't on stalks. We have the next best thing. We can make the bore TELL us where it's pointing. This is the bore sight. This is accomplished by virtually any gun dealer in the country. It can also be done by you in your own home if you have a bore sight yourself. They're fairly cheap and can run as low as $20 at any place like Sportsman's Warehouse. A bore sight is inserted either into the chamber (if the bore sight is shaped like a round) or into the end of the muzzle. It's a laser. It does nothing but point straight ahead. Once that's in there, turn it on and then adjust your windage and elevation until that laser is pointing right on your crosshairs. Bore sight done!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your scope is NOT accurate and is NOT calibrated aka NOT zeroed! Why not? That laser was lined up PERFECTLY with the crosshairs! The problem is, the laser is CLOSE to where the bore is really pointing. Right now, chances are your bullets will land ON THE TARGET. That is what we want!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what now?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We zero it manually! First a lesson on what Minute of Angle (MOA) is. MOA is equal to 1 inch at 100 yards. So if you are shooting 1 inch left of the bullseye, you are 1 MOA left. Your most common scope has an adjustment level of 1/4 MOA. This means if you turn your windage 4 notches left, you have moved your point of impact 1 inch in that direction if you are shooting on a target 100 yards away. 500 yards away? 4 clicks is going to move you 5 inches. 1000 yards? 10 inches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you're aiming at your target. Bore sight was finished long ago. You pull your trigger. Individual rounds don't count. Only where your GROUPS are. With that in mind, make 2 more shots. How close are your rounds to EACH OTHER? If they are close, that means you're shooting accurately. Your RIFLE isn't, but you're doing the work properly. Find the CENTER of your shot group. You look through the scope after you recover from the recoil and you see your group 2.5 inches UP and 3 inches LEFT of your target. Most people say to work on windage first, then work on elevation (or vice versa) but not both at the same time. I agree with this just because it prevents you from mixing things up. Let's hit windage first. Your group is 3 inches to the left. You need to move it 3 inches to the right in order for it to be directly vertical to your bullseye. If 4 clicks means 1 inch at 100 yards, how are you going to move your shot group to the right? 12 clicks right should do it. Take another 3 shots and repeat until your groups are perfectly vertical of the bullseye.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, you have to move the round DOWN until you're on target. If done properly, your round is now 2.5 inches above the bullseye and perfectly centered horizontally. Let's move your round onto the bullseye. 2.5 inches, 4 clicks per inch, you're looking at 4 x 2.5 = 10 clicks. Move your scope down 10 clicks. 3 more shots. Is your shot group on the bullseye? If not, repeat until it is. If it *IS* on the bullseye, congratulations! You've just zeroed your rifle for the 100 year line! You can now say with confidence that with the current settings, your groups should always be spot on assuming YOU are doing YOUR job with the aiming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These settings are always your starting point when shooting at other distances as well. Let's take the 300 yard line as an example. If you point your rifle down range at a target 300 yards away and pull the trigger, since you haven't changed your zero (also called your dope), you should still be SPOT ON, right? No. When you throw a baseball, does it fly in a perfectly straight line? No, it drops more the further it flies. This is the trajectory. Bullets are definitely not immune to the laws of physics. (&quot;Obey physics... IT'S THE LAW!&quot;) You need to use your elevation to compensate for this bullet drop. Here is a table for 155gr .308.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    RANGE   DROP&#xD;&#xA;    100     0&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    200     2.87&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    300     11.2&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    400     25.6&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    500     46.9&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    600     76.0&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    700    114.9&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    800    161.7&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means if you are shooting at 300 yards, your bullet will hit 11.2 inches below the target. You have to move it 11.2 inches UP. We know that 4 clicks is 1 inch at 100 yards. If we're moving it 11.2 inches, that means 45 clicks up right? NO! At 300 yards, 4 clicks is THREE inches. You need to take it up about 15 clicks. If 1 click = 1/4 in at 100 yards, then it equals 3/4 inch at 300 yards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So your zero at 100 yards gives you a baseline. If you move to the 300 yard line, you have to move your round up 11.2 inches if using a 155gr .308. If you move to the 700 yard line, be prepared to move your round up 76.0 inches. Obviously different sized bullets, different amounts of powder, and different calibers will give you slightly different results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wind also has drastic effects on the bullet. The further out your target is, the longer the wind has to affect the path of your bullet, pushing it left or right. Wind coming STRAIGHT AT YOU or wind that is traveling WITH the bullet do not have a measurable effect on the path of the bullet. Only wind coming from the side in any measurable fashion. The amount that you will have to adjust varies very widely depending on the size of the bullet, the caliber of the round, and the amount of powder propelling it. That is far beyond the scope of this article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For extra information (or if you're not yet confused enough), check this link:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://demigodllc.com/articles/practical-long-range-rifle-shooting-optics/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above article is copied almost ver batim from something written by me over here:  http://www.utahconcealedcarry.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=11301  Copy and use the information however you want!" />

These offer the greatest ability to incapacitate a target.

What is important is the twist rate of the rifling, generally specified in number of inches for a full rotation. You can calculate a stability factor for a bullet given the bullet weight, caliber, length, muzzle velocity, and barrel twist rate, plus the temperature and pressure of the air where you are firing. All else being equal, longer bullets, lower twist rates, and lower atmospheric temperatures and altitudes make bullets less stable. Generally, once the stability is above the limit, the bullet will fly straight, and there is no benefit to adding more stability. If the stability is below the limit, then the bullet will tumble in flight and generally be wildly inaccurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For common calibers firing factory loads, this is generally not an issue, as they are all pre-calculated to be stable in all ordinary conditions. The only somewhat common case I know of where this is a problem is for firing M855 or 62 grain bullets in AR15s with the early-model 1 in 12 inch twist barrels. Doing this will reportedly result in group sizes of 1-2 **feet** at 100 yards. If you are doing custom work with unusual ammunition types or calibers, then you should calculate your own stability factors to verify stability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some links for more information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Stability Calculator][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[AR15.com ammo FAQ with more detailed description][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmstab-5.1.cgi&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://ammo.ar15.com/ammo/project/perf_twists.html" />

This ratio is what determines things like drag, blowby, and tendancy to foul. The fewer grooves you have, the easier it can be to clean fouling from the barrel. A smaller number of lands and grooves can also affect a barrel's lifespan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riflebarrels.com/faq_lilja_rifle_barrels.htm#3%20Groove%20and%206%20Groove&quot;&gt;From barrel maker Lilja&lt;/a&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A few years ago we started to make barrels in a 3 groove configuration&#xD;&#xA;&gt; too at the request of some varmint hunters who were looking for longer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; barrel life. They were chambering barrels for hot 22 caliber varmint&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rounds and shooting the throats out of conventional 6 groove barrels&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fairly fast. We reasoned that if we reduced the number of grooves to 3&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but kept the ratio of land to groove width the same (ie. the lands are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; twice as wide in a 3 groove barrel as compared to a 6 groove) that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there would be more land area to resist heat erosion.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Well, it turned out that barrel life did increase and that accuracy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; stayed at least the equal of comparable 6 groove barrels. It is hard&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to put a percentage increase on barrel life but a conservative&#xD;&#xA;&gt; estimate might be 20%.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;...&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;And we found that as a side benefit the 3 groove barrels seemed to foul&#xD;&#xA;&gt;very little and clean up quickly. We attributed this to the reduced&#xD;&#xA;&gt;number of corners inside collecting powder and copper fouling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, other barrel makers have stated that, as long as the ratio of lands to grooves is relatively constant, there is no appreciable difference in accuracy among 3-,4-,5-,6- and 8-groove barrels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Barrel maker Krieger has said:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There isn't any advantage to the shooter. ... Barrel makers use&#xD;&#xA;&gt; different numbers of grooves for ease of manufacturing and ...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; marketing hype.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Higher groove count barrels have slightly slower bullet velocities and also may foul a bit more quickly due to the higher number of edges cutting the bullet jacket and trapping residue.

Sometimes for more money, sometimes as part of the regular price. At almost all levels of shooting this is not something that needs to be worried about, and more focus should be paid to the twist rate. To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting.

As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bullet stability and the number of lands/grooves&#xD;&#xA;The number of lands and grooves in a barrel is not impoartant, but the surface area ratio between the land width and groove width is.

Slip your trigger finger onto the trigger and the rest of your fingers around the pistol grip or wrist just like you would do if you were shouldering the rifle. Look down and see if the face of the butt plate or butt pad rests against your biceps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If it is just touching the surface of your biceps then the LOP is very close to being correct. You can further test for a correct LOP by shouldering the rifle and relaxing your right arm and letting your elbow drop as low as possible without being uncomfortable. Your elbow should be approximately in the centreline of the side of your body.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If it's too far forward the LOP is too long. If it's too far rearward, the LOP is too short. These tests are just initial indicators of correct LOP. Because of variations in shooting styles you may still need to lengthen or shorten the buttstock to gain a correct fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once that's done, if you prefer the traditional style and don't feel like cutting, Choate has a synthetic replacement that will let you adjust from 13-14&quot; LOP in 1/2&quot; increments for about $70.

The default is the G1 projectile, which looks like a WWI artillery shell.  The closer a bullet's shape is to the reference projectile, the more accurate the ballistic coefficent will be.  Unfortunately, most of us aren't shooting rounds shaped like WWI artillery shells.  This means that G1 ballistic coefficents are only accurate for a single velocity.  As you get further from the reference velocity they become increasingly inaccurate.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a different reference projectile, the G7, which is shaped much more like a long range boat-tail rifle bullet.  G7 ballistic coefficents are accurate over a much wider range of velocities than the G1 BC.  Most bullet and ammunition manufacturers don't provide G7 BCs for their bullets, but you can find them from other sources.

The default is the G1 projectile, which looks like a WWI artillery shell.  The closer a bullet's shape is to the reference projectile, the more accurate the ballistic coefficent will be.  Unfortunately, most of us aren't shooting rounds shaped like WWI artillery shells.  This means that G1 ballistic coefficents are only accurate for a single velocity.  As you get further from the reference velocity they become increasingly inaccurate.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a different reference projectile, the G7, which is shaped much more like a long range boat-tail rifle bullet.  G7 ballistic coefficents are accurate over a much wider range of velocities than the G1 BC.  Most bullet and ammunition manufacturers don't provide G7 BCs for their bullets, but you can find them from other sources.

If 62gr ammo from an AR-15 is stabilized by a 1:9 twist, its BC will be the same as if it were stabilized by a 1:7 or 1:8 twist, only changing when stability is lost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, the BC is not affected by velocity, but velocity affects stability. In other words, the higher your initial velocity, the longer — or farther — a bullet in flight can remain stable. It is also unaffected by powder type or charge." />

As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior." />

Another difference to be aware of is the magazine well and upper/lower dimensions. Armalite and DPMS have differing opinions on how this platform should be built, and have established two different patterns of gun. Most of the hard-use-gun makers (LaRue, LWRCi, LMT, Knight's) have standardized around the pattern used by the Knight's SR-25/M110 platform, but I can not remember which of the two the AR-25 is more similar to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;As a side note, the difference between 7.62mm and .308 is the opposite of the difference between 5.56mm and .223 — .308 is the more powerful of the two, and can fire both while 7.62mm chambers should not fire .308 rounds.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The AK-47 platform may be a 7.62mm round, but it's apples-to-oranges to compare it with the 7.62mm NATO or .308 rounds.

The 1:7 will stabilize ALL but the lightest, most specialized loads, while the 1:9 will NOT stabilize heavier and very common self defense loads." Text="&lt;strong&gt;The best all-around twist rates for AR-15 rifles is 1 twist per 7 inches of barrel length, or 1:7. This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.&lt;/strong&gt; Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. &lt;strong&gt;Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.&lt;/strong&gt; To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bullet stability and twist rate&#xD;&#xA;Twist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (&quot;one-in-seven&quot;) twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability&quot;&gt;Greenhill Formula&lt;/a&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Greenhill Formula&quot; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)&#xD;&#xA; - D = bullet's diameter in inches&#xD;&#xA; - L = bullet's length in inches&#xD;&#xA; - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. &lt;strong&gt;The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Early AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior." />

Text="An aftermarket trigger connector can reduce the weight of the trigger pull and change the trigger reset. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a semi-automatic pistol, the weight of the trigger pull is amount of force required to pull the trigger until the sear is released and the gun fires. With the trigger pulled all the way back, the trigger reset is the distance you have to let the trigger move forward before the the internals reset and you can then begin pulling back and fire another cartridge. On many semi-auto pistols, the reset is not the full distance of the trigger pull.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, less trigger movement and less force required can help accuracy. " />

Seen in both pistol and rifle calibers.  Generally the best choice for self defense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Ballistic tip: A bullet with a soft plastic tip.  Ballistic tips are often applied to hollowpoints to make them more aerodynamic.  However, not all ballistic tip bullets are designed to expand.  Some match target bullets, like the Hornady A-MAX line, have ballistic tips for aerodynamic reasons even though they are not designed for expansion.  Ballistic tips are also seen on some ammunition intended for use in tube fed lever action rifles, to avoid setting off the primer of the round in front of it.  " />

Be careful here, this can affect the how reliably you weapon runs as a stiff spring may not allow a lighter load to fully cycle the slide.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Behind the mag well is an open cavity which you can buy a weighted plug for. Note that this and the guide rod change will affect the balance of the weapon.

Whereas steel will give you the mass and less flex. &#xD;&#xA; 3. If you upgrade the guide rod you can change the recoil spring weight. A stiffer spring for a hot or heavy load may help. Be careful here, this can affect the how reliably you weapon runs as a stiff spring may not allow a lighter load to fully cycle the slide.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Behind the mag well is an open cavity which you can buy a weighted plug for. Note that this and the guide rod change will affect the balance of the weapon. You'll need to experiment here to find a balance that works for you.&#xD;&#xA; 5. The last and most expensive is a ported barrel and slide that will redirect some of the exhaust gas up which will lower the amount of muzzle rise and felt recoil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition you can replace the connector bar, trigger spring and/or firing pin spring.

Ignoring some variations in bullet velocity with barrel length, we can think about dwell time in terms of how long the barrel forward of the gas port is.  The other major variable here is how much pressure there is at the gas port to apply force to the bolt.  The closer you are to the chamber, the greater the pressure, the further you are, the lower the pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eugene Stone designed the original M16 with a 20&quot; barrel and a gas port about 13&quot; from the chamber, giving 7&quot; of dwell time.  This is probably the best setup from a pure reliability standpoint, but it's a fairly long weapon, not the best for fighting inside buildings and the like.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the Vietnam war, Colt went through several less than satisfactory designs for shorter versions of the M16 before settling on the Colt Commando (also known as the XM177 or the GAU-5/A).  It had a 11.5&quot; barrel with a gas port 7.5&quot; from the chamber.  Note that compared to the rifle this setup has the gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but this is offset by a shorter dwell time (that pressure is acting for a shorter period of time).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When Colt developed the M4 Carbine, they took the Commando and lengthened the barrel to 14.5 inches, while keeping the gas port 7.5 inches from the chamber.  This makes it possible to mount a bayonet on the carbine because the end of the barrel is the same distance from the gas block as it is on the rifle.  Comparing this to the M16, we have a gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but it now has the same 7 inches of dwell time as the rifle.  This makes the M4 somewhat overgassed compared to the rifle, but it still works fairly well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The military's widespread adoption of the M4 created civilian demand for a look-alike.  However, the National Firearms Act says that a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16&quot; is a Short Barreled Rifle, requiring a bunch of paperwork and paying a $200 tax.  Thus most manufacturers of M4geries added another 1.5 inches to the barrel to meet the 16&quot; minimum.  Now we've got a 16&quot; barrel with a 7.5 inch gas system.  The gas port is closer to the chamber than on an M16 (higher pressure) and the dwell time is *longer*.  This creates a substantially overgassed rifle.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This finally brings us to the midlength gas system.  Manufacturers recognized the issues with 16&quot; barrels and carbine length gas systems.  In response, they moved the gas port forward two inches (to 9.5&quot; from the chamber).  On a gun with a 16&quot; barrel, this produces a rifle with a gas port that's closer to the chamber than an M16 (but further than a carbine), and has a dwell time about on par with the rifle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The carbine length gas system on a 16&quot; barrel is essentially an accident of history.  Now, this isn't to say that a 16&quot; with a carbine length gas system won't run, but it will shoot a bit harder and suffer a bit more wear and tear than a similar gun with the midlength gas system." />

From my martial arts training experience, if new person asks 'when am I going to be a black belt?' that can't be answered as it's very specific to individual abilities and commitment.

This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.&lt;/strong&gt; Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting. A 1:9 barrel will have trouble with loads much heavier than the mid-60gr range, which puts many very effective defense, long range, and hunting loads outside their ability to stabilize.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. &lt;strong&gt;Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.&lt;/strong&gt; To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bullet stability and twist rate&#xD;&#xA;Twist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (&quot;one-in-seven&quot;) twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability&quot;&gt;Greenhill Formula&lt;/a&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Greenhill Formula&quot; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)&#xD;&#xA; - D = bullet's diameter in inches&#xD;&#xA; - L = bullet's length in inches&#xD;&#xA; - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. &lt;strong&gt;The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Early AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic.

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as &quot;Armory Clean&quot; or &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia — &quot;that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it&quot; — keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eagtactical.com/&quot;&gt;EAG Tactical&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as &quot;Filthy 14&quot;. This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#AR Cleaning Wisdom&#xD;&#xA;It is important that you run the rods through the barrel rod-first, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through. This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. If you try to push them through patch-first, you'll bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and it'll be extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pulling with all their worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt; is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Functionally Clean&#xD;&#xA;The level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle&#xD;&#xA; - Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Optional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin out with firing pin&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wipe down all of these and reassemble. If carbon is heavily caked on the neck of the bolt, scrape off the big chunks (removing it all is not necessary).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel (not terribly important to function, but makes the charging handle pull nice and smooth which I like)&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the buffer spring and buffer from the buffer tube, wipe them down, and as much of the interior of the buffer as you can, then replace&#xD;&#xA; - Wipe down the interior of the lower receiver&#xD;&#xA; - Wipe down the exterior of the rifle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reassemble, lube, and function check. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Armory or Inspection Clean&#xD;&#xA; - Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and cam pin&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same optional bit applies here about &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you scrape &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the carbon off the neck of the bolt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the extractor by pressing out the extractor retaining pin with the tip of the firing pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clean the bolt face (where the locking lugs are and the firing pin protrudes) now that the extractor is out of the way. Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the handguards if you can.&#xD;&#xA; - Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using q-tips (the kind with a swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle) clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)&#xD;&#xA; - The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)&#xD;&#xA; - The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in — looks like a star to some people)&#xD;&#xA; - The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake&#xD;&#xA; - Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver&#xD;&#xA; - The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver&#xD;&#xA; - Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates&#xD;&#xA; - The front wall of the chamber of the barrel&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. &lt;strong&gt;Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch&lt;/strong&gt;. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along. If they are not, repeat this process with one wet patch and dry-until-clean until you see the walls of the barrel shine.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You must understand that getting a rifle &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will &quot;bleed&quot; cleaner and filth and your rifle will be dirty again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Footnotes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;1:&lt;/em&gt; collapsible stocks can be removed by simply pulling down on the pin that allows you to select the length setting. There is a channel on the bottom of the buffer tube with notches set deeper at specific lengths (usually 4 or 6 of them from start to end). Grab the lever that disengages this pin from the notches and pull it down farther than would be done if you used the lever. This will raise the pin higher than the rear wall of the channel and allow you to pull the stock completely off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT LOSE THIS PIN.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;3:&lt;/em&gt; Having the extractor removed will also help you to get the swab part of your cotton swabs out of the bolt when they rip off while you try to pull them out of the firing pin channel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;4:&lt;/em&gt; This is my system for running wet and dry patches. Everybody has a different one. You will never win the battle of the barrel. It will never be completely clean. Do not stress over this." />

It's also a great time to replace parts that need replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, and gas rings. Check your gas rings by setting the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight.

Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the handguards if you can.&#xD;&#xA; - Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using q-tips clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)&#xD;&#xA; - The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)&#xD;&#xA; - The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in — looks like a star to some people)&#xD;&#xA; - The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake&#xD;&#xA; - Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver&#xD;&#xA; - The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver&#xD;&#xA; - Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates&#xD;&#xA; - The front wall of the chamber of the barrel&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. &lt;strong&gt;Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch&lt;/strong&gt;. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along.

There is a channel on the bottom of the buffer tube with notches set deeper at specific lengths (usually 4 or 6 of them from start to end). Grab the lever that disengages this pin from the notches and pull it down farther than would be done if you used the lever. This will raise the pin higher than the rear wall of the channel and allow you to pull the stock completely off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT LOSE THIS PIN.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;3:&lt;/em&gt; Having the extractor removed will also help you to get the swab part of your cotton swabs out of the bolt when they rip off while you try to pull them out of the firing pin channel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;4:&lt;/em&gt; This is my system for running wet and dry patches. Everybody has a different one. You will never win the battle of the barrel. It will never be completely clean. Do not stress over this." />

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as &quot;Armory Clean&quot; or &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia — &quot;that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it&quot; — keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eagtactical.com/&quot;&gt;EAG Tactical&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as &quot;Filthy 14&quot;. This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#AR Cleaning Wisdom&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;It is important that you run cleaning rods through the barrel rod-first-patch-last, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. &lt;strong&gt;If you try to push them through patch-first, the patch turns back toward the rod and wraps it up, making it too big around to fit through the barrel.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and make this job extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pushing with all they're worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt; is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You will use q-tips to clean the rifle no matter how clean you want it. Functionally clean will require far fewer of them. Get the kind with a tightly wrapped swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle. The tighter the swab on the end, the less likely it is to rip off and leave pieces in impossible-to-reach places. It's also smaller and will fit better in places like the firing pin channel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You must understand that getting a rifle &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. &quot;Functionally Clean&quot; will cover most of them with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will &quot;bleed&quot; cleaner and filth and your rifle will be &quot;dirty&quot; again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay. You don't need to clean your rifle for three days in a row.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Inspecting Your Rifle's Serviceability&#xD;&#xA;Before, during, and after cleaning is a great time to inspect your rifle for worn, damaged, or broken parts. It's also a great time to replace parts that need replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, and gas rings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To check your gas rings, set the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight. If it does not fall closed, bump the table or whatever it's sitting on, and it should fall part way but not completely closed. If it does fall closed, you need new gas rings. &lt;strong&gt;You do not need all three gas rings for the gun to run. You do not need to make sure the gas ring gaps are not lined up. I've run thousands of rounds through an M4 on a range with 1 gas ring.&lt;/strong&gt; But if you're missing gas rings, there's no reason you shouldn't replace them with a fresh set if you have the chance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Things I inspect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do both hammer spring legs mirror each other?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the hammer lose or does it not swing in a straight path?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the canted, or not parallel in the sides of the lower receiver? &#xD;&#xA; - Is the gas tube parallel with the charging handle channel in the upper receiver? &#xD;&#xA; - Does the carrier slide forward easily, and without noticeable movement of the gas tube?&#xD;&#xA; - Is there only one lug on one side of the extractor?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the firing pin retaining pin looking like its had better days?&#xD;&#xA; - Are my sights canted?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Only use your barrel cleaning patches once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't use toilet paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Functionally Clean&#xD;&#xA;The level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running.

I try to get a couple hundred rounds per month through my rifle, so this is probably every six months or so. Long-term storage for me is very rare. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&#xD;&#xA; - Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and cam pin&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same optional bit applies here about &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;.

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as &quot;Armory Clean&quot; or &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia — &quot;that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it&quot; — keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eagtactical.com/&quot;&gt;EAG Tactical&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as &quot;Filthy 14&quot;. This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#AR Cleaning Wisdom&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;It is important that you run cleaning rods through the barrel rod-first-patch-last, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. &lt;strong&gt;If you try to push them through patch-first, the patch turns back toward the rod and wraps it up, making it too big around to fit through the barrel.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and make this job extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pushing with all they're worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt; is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You will use q-tips to clean the rifle no matter how clean you want it. Functionally clean will require far fewer of them. Get the kind with a tightly wrapped swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle. The tighter the swab on the end, the less likely it is to rip off and leave pieces in impossible-to-reach places. It's also smaller and will fit better in places like the firing pin channel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You must understand that getting a rifle &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. &quot;Functionally Clean&quot; will cover most of them with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will &quot;bleed&quot; cleaner and filth and your rifle will be &quot;dirty&quot; again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay. You don't need to clean your rifle for three days in a row.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Inspecting Your Rifle's Serviceability&#xD;&#xA;Before, during, and after cleaning is a great time to inspect your rifle for worn, damaged, or broken parts. It's also a great time to replace parts that need regular replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, firing pin retaining pin, and gas rings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To check your gas rings, set the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight. If it does not fall closed, bump the table or whatever it's sitting on, and it should fall part way but not completely closed. If it does fall closed, you need new gas rings. &lt;strong&gt;You do not need all three gas rings for the gun to run. You do not need to make sure the gas ring gaps are not lined up. I've run thousands of rounds through an M4 on a range with 1 gas ring.&lt;/strong&gt; But if you're missing gas rings, there's no reason you shouldn't replace them with a fresh set if you have the chance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Things I inspect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do both hammer spring legs mirror each other?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the hammer lose or does it not swing in a straight path?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the hammer canted, or not parallel to the sides of the lower receiver? &#xD;&#xA; - Is the gas tube parallel with the charging handle channel in the upper receiver? &#xD;&#xA; - Does the carrier slide forward easily, and without noticeable movement of the gas tube?&#xD;&#xA; - Is there only one lug on one side of the extractor?&#xD;&#xA; - Is the firing pin retaining pin looking like its had better days?&#xD;&#xA; - Are my sights canted?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Only use your barrel cleaning patches once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't re-use toilet paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Functionally Clean&#xD;&#xA;The level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle&#xD;&#xA; - Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Optional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; out with firing pin&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wipe down all of these parts. If carbon is heavily caked on the neck of the bolt, scrape it off (removing it all is not necessary, don't obsess over it). Clean the firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point you can run a bore snake through your barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. &lt;strong&gt;Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch&lt;/strong&gt;. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean.

For example, Michigan re-legalized the purchase of suppressors in September 2011 after having them disallowed back in 1977 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shekel.blogspot.com/2011/09/sound-of-silencers-can-now-return-to.html&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;). Regarding machine guns, &lt;strong&gt;a transferable machine gun is one that was manufactured and registered before the closing of the registry on May 19th 1986&lt;/strong&gt;. Any machine gun manufactured after that date can only be owned by law enforcement, government, or FFLs paying the SOT. If machine guns of modern manufacture are what you're after, see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot; and evaluate the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the type of NFA firearm or suppresser you want is allowed in your state, the next step is to decide if you're going to &quot;manufacture&quot; your firearm or suppressor (filling out a &quot;form 1&quot;, or simply transfer it from the manufacturer to you (filling out a &quot;form 4&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two types of forms a person needs to know are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.1 (Form 1) — Application to make and Register a Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.4 (Form 4) — Application For Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These forms can be found — along with instructions for their use — at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/firearms/&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms Forms&lt;/a&gt; page and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms FAQ for the National Firearms Act&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##For transfer (to an individual, in my state):&#xD;&#xA;I want to buy a suppressor, or a rifle or shotgun that was registered as a short barrel version at the factory by the original manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase the firearm or suppressor&#xD;&#xA; - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&#xD;&#xA; - When the firearm or suppressor arrives at your dealer, go to them and fill out ATF Form 4 — again in duplicate&#xD;&#xA; - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 4s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the package is returned to you with a copy of the approved forms and your attached stamp, take this paperwork into the dealer that's been holding your NFA firearm or suppressor for all these months. Most FFLs will charge you a rather large sum for transferring an NFA firearm or suppressor, which you will now pay and he'll hand over your merchandise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##For manufacture of a firearm (as an individual, in my state):&#xD;&#xA;I already have, or will soon have, a rifle or shotgun that I would like to convert to a short barrel version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase the firearm&#xD;&#xA; - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&#xD;&#xA; - Fill out ATF Form 1 — again in duplicate&#xD;&#xA; - Engrave your name, city and state on the firearm's serialized part — you must use a permanent section of the serialized part (the trigger guard or buttstock of an AR-15 are not allowed)&#xD;&#xA; - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your Sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 1s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back. &lt;strong&gt;Once you have the paperwork returned, you are allowed to assemble or modify your weapon.&lt;/strong&gt; You can purchase short-barreled uppers for AR-15s at any time, for example. Mounting that upper to a lower is illegal until the paperwork has been returned and your lower is engraved. Having a gunsmith modify the barrel length of your shotgun is illegal before the paperwork has been returned and the receiver is engraved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Variables&#xD;&#xA;Timelines for this fluctuate constantly. When I purchased two SBRs on a Form 4 back in 2006, the ATF took just over 2 months to return my paperwork to me. Current reported wait times as of early November 2011 are as high as 6 months. Some people report that a trust or corp makes their process go faster, others have experienced the opposite.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;there are a lot of variables in this process, state by state and for special situations&lt;/strong&gt;. State to state, laws allowing certain types of NFA weapons and suppressors can be different. Different people in the Sheriff's seat can choose to not sign off on your Form 4 or Form 1. They can also choose to simply not sign &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; NFA paperworkat all. This leads us to yet another variable: trusts and incorporation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A trust or a corporation (S corp, C corp, LLC, etc.) can own NFA firearms and suppressors. This can either be a true company such as a gun store (see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot;), or it can be an corporation or trust acting on behalf of an individual (you). The biggest advantages to doing a trust or corporation are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Reduction in paperwork&#xD;&#xA;  - Trusts and corporations can not have fingerprints or passport photos, so these are not required&#xD;&#xA;  - Trusts and corporations do not require a Sheriff's signature on the Form 1 or Form 4 (this is how you get around a grumpy, no-signature Sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Flexibility with the handling of NFA firearms after your death&#xD;&#xA; - Any trustee or member can possess and use the firearm or suppressor, rather than only the individual listed on the Form 1 or 4&#xD;&#xA; - Removals of many liabilities from the individual&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many more intricacies and benefits to a corporation or trust. Trusts are preferred to corporations generally because corporations have ongoing fees associated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The best advice I can give you about trusts is to talk to a lawyer who has set up NFA Trusts.&lt;/strong&gt; There can be differences between the setup of a trust for NFA items and a trust for normal assets. A lot of law firms and estate planning firms will have experience here, and again things can vary state-to-state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncestateplanningblog.com/2009/11/articles/estate-planning/trusts/nfa-gun-trusts-provide-many-advantages/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a good write-up about the advantages of using a trust for NFA items. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#I Want To Become A Dealer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be a dealer you must obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). An FFL alone will not let you purchase or manufacture NFA weapons. First you must obtain the right FFL, or combination of FFLs, from the many different types, to be eligible to obtain status as a special operations taxes payer. You must obtain status as a special operations taxes payer for the additional privileges of dealing with NFA weapons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Federal Firearms Licenses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ATF considers you a &quot;dealer&quot; if you make more than a certain level of your income from firearms. This includes gunsmiths and ammunition makers as you will see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Type 1 FFL is a Title 1 dealer or gunsmith&#xD;&#xA; - Type 2 FFL is a Title 1 dealer doing business as a pawnbroker&#xD;&#xA; - Type 3 FFL is a licensed collector of Curio &amp; Relic (C&amp;R) firearms&#xD;&#xA; - Type 6 FFL is a licensed maker of ammunition and reloading components other than armor piercing ammunition&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - Type 7 FFL is a Title 1 manufacturer of firearms, ammunition and ammunition components other than NFA,  Destructive Devices and Armor Piercing ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 8 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms and ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 9 FFL is a dealer in Title 1 firearms including NFA destructive devices, but no other NFA&#xD;&#xA; - Type 10 FFL is a manufacturer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and ammunition components, including NFA Destructive Devices but no other NFA, and not including Armor Piercing ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 11 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and NFA Destructive Devices, but no other NFA&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Special Operations Taxes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NFA firearms are one of these supplemental privileges.  These supplemental taxes are referred to as &quot;Special Operations Taxes&quot; (or just &quot;SOT&quot;) and as with all things, there are different types:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 3 SOT dealer&lt;/strong&gt; is a dealer of NFA firearms&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 2 SOT manufacturer&lt;/strong&gt; is a manufacturer of NFA firearms&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 1 SOT importer&lt;/strong&gt; is an importer of NFA firearms &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that these are in addition to the tax payer being a licensed dealer (holder of a FFL) already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;To be eligible for Class 3 SOT status, you need a dealer or manufacturer FFL: Type 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $500, due on July 1st.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be eligible for Class 2 SOT status, you need a manufacturer FFL: Types 7 or 10. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be eligible for Class 1 SOT status, you need an importer FFL: Types 8 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reduced tax rates are for small importers and manufacturers. All additional taxes are due on July 1st of each year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy?&#xD;&#xA; 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)&#xD;&#xA; 4. &lt;strong&gt;FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&#xD;&#xA; 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've &lt;em&gt;shot the gun&lt;/em&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith &amp; Wesson's M&amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;" />

The narrower magazines are intended to make it easier for people with average hands to grip them, but it kind of undermines those of us with large hands.  These include the M&amp;P .45, the HK USP Compact and HK45.

For example, Michigan re-legalized the purchase of suppressors in September 2011 after having them disallowed back in 1977 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shekel.blogspot.com/2011/09/sound-of-silencers-can-now-return-to.html&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;). Regarding machine guns, &lt;strong&gt;a transferable machine gun is one that was manufactured and registered prior to the closing of the registry on May 19th, 1986&lt;/strong&gt;. Any machine gun manufactured after that date can only be owned by law enforcement, government, or FFLs paying the SOT. If machine guns of modern manufacture are what you're after, see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot; and evaluate the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the type of NFA firearm or suppresser you want is allowed in your state, the next step is to decide if you're going to &quot;manufacture&quot; — usually more accurately described as &quot;convert&quot; — your existing firearm (filling out a &quot;form 1&quot;), or simply transfer it as an existing NFA firearm or suppressor from the manufacturer to you (filling out a &quot;form 4&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two types of forms a person needs to know are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.1 (Form 1) — Application to make and Register a Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.4 (Form 4) — Application For Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These forms can be found — along with instructions for their use — at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/firearms/&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms Forms&lt;/a&gt; page and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms FAQ for the National Firearms Act&lt;/a&gt; page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##For transfer (to an individual, in my state):&#xD;&#xA;I want to buy a suppressor, or a rifle or shotgun that was registered as a short barrel version at the factory by the original manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase the firearm or suppressor&#xD;&#xA; - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&#xD;&#xA; - When the firearm or suppressor arrives at your dealer, go to them and fill out ATF Form 4 — again in duplicate&#xD;&#xA; - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 4s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the package is returned to you with a copy of the approved forms and your attached stamp, take this paperwork into the dealer that's been holding your NFA firearm or suppressor for all these months. Most FFLs will charge you a rather large sum for transferring an NFA firearm or suppressor, which you will now pay and he'll hand over your merchandise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##For manufacture of a firearm (as an individual, in my state):&#xD;&#xA;I already have, or will soon have, a rifle or shotgun that I would like to convert to a short barrel version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase the firearm&#xD;&#xA; - Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&#xD;&#xA; - Fill out ATF Form 1 — again in duplicate&#xD;&#xA; - Engrave your name, city and state on the firearm's serialized part — you must use a permanent section of the serialized part (the trigger guard or buttstock of an AR-15 are not allowed)&#xD;&#xA; - Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your Sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 1s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back. &lt;strong&gt;Once you have the paperwork returned, you are allowed to assemble or modify your weapon.&lt;/strong&gt; You can purchase short-barreled uppers for AR-15s at any time, for example. Mounting that upper to a lower is illegal until the paperwork has been returned and your lower is engraved. Having a gunsmith modify the barrel length of your shotgun is illegal before the paperwork has been returned and the receiver is engraved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Variables&#xD;&#xA;Timelines for this fluctuate constantly. When I purchased two SBRs on a Form 4 back in 2006, the ATF took just over 2 months to return my paperwork to me. Current reported wait times as of early November 2011 are as high as 6 months. Some people report that a trust or corp makes their process go faster, others have experienced the opposite.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;there are a lot of variables in this process, state by state and for special situations&lt;/strong&gt;. State to state, laws allowing certain types of NFA weapons and suppressors can be different. Different people in the Sheriff's seat can choose to not sign off on your Form 4 or Form 1. They can also choose to simply not sign &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; NFA paperworkat all. This leads us to yet another variable: trusts and incorporation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A trust or a corporation (S corp, C corp, LLC, etc.) can own NFA firearms and suppressors. This can either be a true company such as a gun store (see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot;), or it can be a corporation or trust acting on behalf of an individual (you, your estate) or group (your family). The biggest advantages (to me) in doing a trust or corporation are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Reduction in paperwork&#xD;&#xA;  - Trusts and corporations can not have fingerprints or passport photos, so these are not required&#xD;&#xA;  - Trusts and corporations do not require a Sheriff's signature on the Form 1 or Form 4 (this is how you get around a grumpy, no-signature Sheriff)&#xD;&#xA; - Flexibility with the handling of NFA firearms after your death&#xD;&#xA; - Any trustee or member can possess and use the firearm or suppressor, rather than only the individual listed on the Form 1 or 4&#xD;&#xA; - Removals of many liabilities from the individual&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many more intricacies and benefits to a corporation or trust. Trusts are preferred to corporations generally because corporations have ongoing fees associated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The best advice I can give you about trusts is to talk to a lawyer who has set up NFA Trusts.&lt;/strong&gt; There can be differences between the setup of a trust for NFA items and a trust for normal assets. A lot of law firms and estate planning firms will have experience here, and again things can vary state-to-state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncestateplanningblog.com/2009/11/articles/estate-planning/trusts/nfa-gun-trusts-provide-many-advantages/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a good write-up about the advantages of using a trust for NFA items. Lawyers from some states may or may not be able to practice in your state, so this may only be good for reference. Maybe the author can practice in your state as well as his or you live in the same state, in which case he can help you. Again, you'll have to do your homework.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#I Want To Become A Dealer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be a dealer you must obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). An FFL alone will not let you purchase or manufacture NFA weapons. First you must obtain the right FFL, or combination of FFLs, from the many different types, to be eligible to obtain status as a special operations taxes payer. You must obtain status as a special operations taxes payer for the additional privileges of dealing with NFA weapons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Federal Firearms Licenses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ATF considers you a &quot;dealer&quot; if you make more than a certain level of your income from firearms. This includes gunsmiths and ammunition makers as you will see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Type 1 FFL is a Title 1 dealer or gunsmith&#xD;&#xA; - Type 2 FFL is a Title 1 dealer doing business as a pawnbroker&#xD;&#xA; - Type 3 FFL is a licensed collector of Curio &amp; Relic (C&amp;R) firearms&#xD;&#xA; - Type 6 FFL is a licensed maker of ammunition and reloading components other than armor piercing ammunition&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA; - Type 7 FFL is a Title 1 manufacturer of firearms, ammunition and ammunition components other than NFA,  Destructive Devices and Armor Piercing ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 8 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms and ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 9 FFL is a dealer in Title 1 firearms including NFA destructive devices, but no other NFA&#xD;&#xA; - Type 10 FFL is a manufacturer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and ammunition components, including NFA Destructive Devices but no other NFA, and not including Armor Piercing ammunition&#xD;&#xA; - Type 11 FFL is an importer of Title 1 firearms, ammunition and NFA Destructive Devices, but no other NFA&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Special Operations Taxes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NFA firearms are one of these supplemental privileges.  These supplemental taxes are referred to as &quot;Special Operations Taxes&quot; (or just &quot;SOT&quot;) and as with all things, there are different types:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 3 SOT dealer&lt;/strong&gt; is a dealer of NFA firearms&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 2 SOT manufacturer&lt;/strong&gt; is a manufacturer of NFA firearms&#xD;&#xA; - A &lt;strong&gt;Class 1 SOT importer&lt;/strong&gt; is an importer of NFA firearms &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that these are in addition to the tax payer being a licensed dealer (holder of a FFL) already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;To be eligible for Class 3 SOT status, you need a dealer or manufacturer FFL: Type 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $500.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be eligible for Class 2 SOT status, you need a manufacturer FFL: Types 7 or 10. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be eligible for Class 1 SOT status, you need an importer FFL: Types 8 or 11. You will pay an additional yearly tax of $1000 or $500.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reduced tax rates are for small importers and manufacturers. All additional taxes are due on July 1st of each year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

But, what type of self defense? Home? In public? While these two examples are similar, they create different requirements. If you want to carry a concealed weapon for self defense in public, you will likely choose a smaller form factor. Home defense may warrant a larger handgun. Furthermore, who or what are you defending against? Human targets or wildlife? For example, having a revolver loaded with snake shot is great on the ranch in Arizona (the U.S. state with the most rattlesnakes), but I wouldn't choose it in a gunfight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you really know the purpose of a weapon, it will be clearer what weapon you need, what ammunition works best, what training you'll seek, and what special considerations come into play (like a concealed carry permit)." />

If you handload, use known-good match bullets, or if you need to use hunting bullets use one of the hunting bullets that has a reputation for accuracy.  If you don't handload, try to choose factory ammo that uses a high quality bullet.  For what it's worth I have found that Nosler Ballistic Tip bullets are nearly as accurate as match bullets (and they are sometimes available in factory ammo too).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a pretty good chance that your rifle's bedding is decent enough as-is.  One thing worth doing is to take the rifle out of the stock and ensure that the receiver and the interior are not oil soaked (e.g. from cleaning solvent).  If it is, wipe it clean and dry.  Assemble your action into your stock and tighten the screws to a uniform &quot;very snug&quot; level.  You don't want to damage the screw heads or overstress the screws, but you do want it good and snug.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cleaning your barrel from time to time can help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're not already a well-practiced shooter.... well, practice shooting!  Firing groups from support off of a bench might be easier that shooting offhand, but it is still very hard to get really superb results.  Practice at it and your shooting will improve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You don't need a particularly light trigger to shoot a rifle accurately.  Having a really clean and crisp trigger can make it much easier to shoot well.  Fortunately your trigger as it came from the factory is probably pretty darn good.  If not, have it adjusted so that it is clean and crisp.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)&#xD;&#xA; 4. &lt;strong&gt;FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&#xD;&#xA; 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer.

Glock's pistols and Smith &amp; Wesson's M&amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;" />

This will allow you to practice your fundamentals of pistol marksmanship with the gun layout and controls you'll be using in a self defense situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#The Fundamentals&#xD;&#xA;##(And How You Can Relearn Them If You're Broken)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;A strong foundation in the fundamentals of pistol marksmanship is the most important asset you can give yourself.The weight and caliber of the weapon will not have an appreciable affect accuracy if you have these fundamentals.&lt;/strong&gt; What weight and caliber will affect is felt recoil, which can have effects on your accuracy through things like anticipation of recoil, grip, and trigger use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know from personal experience how bad anticipation can be. When I first started shooting handguns, my cousin gave me a 1911 in .45 ACP. I didn't know anything about anything at the time, and for years I had to fight the natural urge to dip the barrel down in order to compensate for the muzzle flip post-firing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compensation of this kind will lead to heartache. You can not, and must not try to, compensate for the recoil of a handgun. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tricks that I have used to get over this are three-fold. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Shoot the heck out of a .22 LR handgun. Get a .22LR conversion for&#xD;&#xA;    your handgun of choice and shoot A LOT. The point of using the .22 is to&#xD;&#xA;    allow you to get used to the function of the gun without the worry&#xD;&#xA;    of recoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the&#xD;&#xA;    fundamentals is vital here.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Dry fire practice. Dry fire practice is essential for learning&#xD;&#xA;    trigger control. Make sure you dry fire with your centerfire&#xD;&#xA;    slide if you are using a conversion, not your rimfire slide.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rimfire guns should not be dry fired.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the fundamentals is vital&#xD;&#xA;    here.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 3. When firing your gun in its normal caliber, pull the trigger&#xD;&#xA;    extremely slowly. Focus on your control of the weapon but do not focus on the trigger&#xD;&#xA;    break. Let the round firing &quot;surprise&quot; you, and assess your&#xD;&#xA;    accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the fundamentals is vital&#xD;&#xA;    here.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also have a friend put their finger into the trigger guard from beside you and, with your finger on the trigger, have him press your finger rearward while you focus on all the previously mentioned fundamentals. This will truly give you no idea about when the round will fire and let you focus on keeping everything else in line.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The previously mentioned fundamentals you should be focusing on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - finger placement on the trigger&#xD;&#xA; - proper trigger press&#xD;&#xA; - good grip&#xD;&#xA; - proper sight picture/alignment&#xD;&#xA; - visual focus on thefront sight rather than the target&#xD;&#xA; - control of breathing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finger placement on the trigger was covered in another question here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/q/184/32&quot;&gt;Rounds are going low and left. What am I doing wrong?&lt;/a&gt;. For a right handed shooter, &quot;too much finger&quot; can cause the gun to pull to the right and &quot;not enough finger&quot; can push the gun to the left. The answers on that question do an exceptional job of explaining the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Purchasing A Pistol&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I generally give these pieces of advice when purchasing a pistol (to be done in this order):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy? (In your case, either learning with a .22 or learning and self defense with a standard handgun and .22 conversion.)&#xD;&#xA; 2. Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)&#xD;&#xA; 4. &lt;strong&gt;FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&#xD;&#xA; 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've &lt;em&gt;shot the gun&lt;/em&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith &amp; Wesson's M&amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;" />

There are other difference, like sights vs. a bead, pistol grips, etc. But barrel length is the biggest difference. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any home defense shotgun that allows you to change the barrel would work as a clay sports gun or a field gun. If you're looking to just become more comfortable with your home defense gun, I would recommend playing clay sports with as little as possible changed. I've shot trap and sporting clays with an 18.5&quot; iron-sighted barrel and did just fine. Some clubs don't allow barrels shorter than a certain length (often 22&quot;) so having the longer barrel is handy. But, if you're looking for practice with your home defense gun, change as little as possible. Folks at the club may chuckle at your tactical gun, ignore them and have fun." />

Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&#xD;&#xA; 6. After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've &lt;em&gt;shot the gun&lt;/em&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith &amp; Wesson's M&amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Training&#xD;&#xA;The next step you can take is to find a local training company with a good reputation. Ask around at the range when you see people who seem to know what they're doing. Ask a cop if you happen to run into one walking around the mall. Ask any of your friends or acquaintances that are gun enthusiasts. Generally with training, as with guns and ammo, you'll get what you pay for. There are also large companies that travel all around the United States offering training classes in different areas. If one of these may be in your area or close enough for you to drive to, you can take a class with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to that, taking the classes for a concealed carry permit (even if it's unlikely that you will be issued one) is a good place to get a basic grasp on the laws surrounding self defense and deadly force. I recommend caution here, as many instructors I've dealt with love to include opinion and preference right along with their presentation of the course. Looking up your local laws directly and speaking with other people at local training courses is great for this. A caveat to traveling trainers is they are unlikely to be as intimately familiar with your local laws (however many states share similar basics)." />

I can find no better reference for selecting a qualified duty 1911 than Hilton Yam's article at 10-8 Performance titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10-8performance.com/pages/Choosing-a-1911-for-Duty-Use.html&quot;&gt;Choosing a 1911 for Duty Use&lt;/a&gt;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A quick example of the first part of his opinion about using the 1911 for duty:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; First off, if you are truly serious about running a 1911, it needs to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be a full sized 5&quot; gun in .45 ACP. There certainly are any number of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; examples of Commander and other compact 1911s that work or can be made&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to work just fine, and for CCW use they can be a viable option for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; some users. However, take a look at the history of unit issue service&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1911s - LAPD SWAT, USSOCOM, USMC Det-1, USMC MEUSOC, FBI HRT, FBI&#xD;&#xA;&gt; SWAT, and let's not forget over 95 years with all the branches of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; U.S. military - and you won't find ANY major units that use anything&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other than the original full sized gun. Why? After you field 50 or 350&#xD;&#xA;&gt; guns at once and run thousands or even tens of thousands of rounds&#xD;&#xA;&gt; through them during training cycles, you'll figure it out. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; By virtue&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of their design, the shorter format 1911s reduce the window of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; functional opportunity for the magazine and slide to work together to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; feed, chamber, extract, and eject. This is an incontrovertible fact of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; life. Proper weapon setup, spring rates, and magazine maintenance are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; critical in running the shorter guns. Keeping after a few 1911s as a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; single hobbyist or aficionado is different than running a bunch of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; guns for a large unit. Remember that weapon down time equates to lost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; training and operational time. You want to minimize your maintenance&#xD;&#xA;&gt; issues, not increase them. Lastly, a full sized 1911 is very arguably&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a more efficient shooting and ballistic delivery platform than a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; smaller sized variant for the majority of users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One subject which we disagree on is that a Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW) gun is not a duty gun. However, his argument is that a CCW gun can be the center of your attention, that you can dedicate the time and effort required to get it running right and keep it that way. This is time and effort a unit-level armorer can not spend on individual guns when he has to take care of a huge number of them, and in your case your requirement is also that you don't want to spend a lot of time and money getting your gun in working condition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion, CCW and duty guns both must be reliable out of the box and have a minimum of required modification and/or upkeep to be reliable." />

Weight doesn't factor in accuracy directly, apart from making it easier for you to hold the gun and align the sights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in slow fire / range / bullseye type shooting, work on your sight picture and trigger pull/press.

My list of these are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Decent sights. The dots on my Springfield Armory Mil-Spec sights are devilish hard to see under all but ideal lighting conditions. Also, in most cases, upgrading your sights will require either a gunsmith or some specialized tools and know-how.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. A decent barrel. There's somewhat of a lowest-common-denominator effect here in that a lot of barrels are more accurate than a lot of shooters, but upgrading your barrel properly requires some gunsmith work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Safety. This is something that isn't terribly hard in most cases to upgrade, but a secure, easy-to-manipulate safety is extremely important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Trigger. Try the trigger on any gun before you buy it. A smooth, reliable trigger is key to safety and accuracy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond these, things like match-grade components are more than most shooters need. If you yourself are a proficient, match-grade shooter then you'll probably want to think about them, but otherwise you can save the money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as 1911s that meet these criteria, the entry level Taurus 1911s have quite good sights, a good (ambidextrous) safety, and reasonable smooth but crisp triggers. I'm well-pleased with everything but the sights on my Springfield Mil-Spec. I have no experience with STI or Rock Island." />

Being such a simple rifle, what you need to look for is rather easy to do. After you ensure that the rifle is unloaded and pointed in a safe direction:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Check the serial numbers on the bolt handle, bolt, receiver, and/or barrel to make sure they match. A Mosin might not have all of these serial numbers on these parts, but any numbers it does have on these specific parts should match to ensure proper head-spacing.&#xD;&#xA; - Rotate the bolt handle up and pull it fully rearward, pull the trigger and remove the bolt. Check the barrel for a good shine and note that the reflected light is straight. By this I mean if you look directly down the barrel the reflected light should form an equilateral triangle. As you rotate the barrel, the sides of the the &quot;triangle&quot; should be straight, any curving indicates the barrel is bent  (the more pronounced the curve, the more severe the bend).&#xD;&#xA; - If you are buying a &quot;new&quot; Mosin, directly from a dealer, then it may have cosmoline in the barrel and possibly some soaked into the stock. So don't reject a rifle if the barrel looks a little dirty, but note that the cosmoline may be hiding rust or bulges. However, if buying a used Mosin, it should have been cleaned and no cosmoline should remain.&#xD;&#xA; - On the whole this next point is not a big issue, but to some it matters. Repair of the crown, or counter-boring, is done to a rifle that has received some sort of damage on the muzzle end of the rifle's barrel and is detectable by running your finger around for about an inch inside the muzzle and not feeling any rifling. You may lose a small amount of velocity and accuracy, but it is rather inconsequential. If you prefer a rifle which has not been damaged enough to require repair, then look keep looking, there are plenty out there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For tons more info check out [7.62x54r.net][1] (general info), and these forum threads: [this one from calguns.net][2], www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-482070.html , and www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-385289.html (what to look for when buying).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://7.62x54r.net/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?p=6450730" />

And I say this as a guy who has is always wanting more magnification in his rifle scopes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For spotting scopes, **somewhere between 20X and 25X** is what is most commonly used for 1000 yards shooting.  I would suggest that you use something similar for 100 yard shooting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ability to resolve detail (be that bullet holes, mirage etc) is much more dependent on the **clarity/sharpness of the the image** than the magnification used.  That is why seemingly-modest magnifications are used even for 1000 yard shooting; the difference between a $1000-$2000 25X scope and a $200 25X scope is not the magnification, it is mostly image sharpness (and to a certain extent waterproofedness).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many low end scopes are variable magnification, with top end magnifications of 60X or 80X.  In my experience the high end magnification of these scopes simply makes the field of view smaller and the image bigger and cloudier - it does not improve your ability to resolve small details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's nothing particularly wrong with variable magnification and I wouldn't avoid buying a scope because it is a variable, but I also would not consider having variable magnification to be a feature worth paying for at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bird watchers and photographers are bigger users of spotting scopes than shooters.  Many features important to them such as colour trueness, fringing, low-light performance etc, aren't actually very important to shooters (in my opinion).  One can optimize a scope selection for shooting performance differently than birders or photographers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to magnification there are some other considerations.  **Eye relief** is one of the most important (this means how close your eyeball has to be to the eyepiece in order to see the image).  Most low-cost scopes require that your eye be so close as to be nearly touching the eyepiece.  Not only is this impossible to use if you wear glasses, even if you don't wear glasses it is very inconvenient.  You will find it much easier to use a scope that allows for an inch or even more of eye relied.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some scopes are &quot;straight through&quot; (like a rifle scope), others have the eyepiece at a 45 degree angle.  In most shooting positions it requires less shifting from a shooting position to look through a 45 degree eyepiece.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Say a shooter is steady enough aiming and trigger control to break our shots within (say) a 3&quot; circle at 100 yards.  Obviously if he is aiming at a target at 20 yards he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 1/5th the size (since 20 yards is 5 times closer than 100 yards).  And if he is aiming at a target 300 yards away, he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 3 times as large (because 300 yards is 3 times as far as 100 yards).  But in all cases, he is breaking his shots inside a 3 MOA circle, which is why it is much more convenient to describe the accuracy of a shooter in terms of MOA rather than in inches (because &quot;inches&quot; alone isn't enough, it always has to be paired with the distance too).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now as why MOA and why not other angular units (such as mils, or decimal degrees)?  A few reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- when measuring distances in yards and bullet locations in inches, an MOA is so close to being &quot;an inch per hundred yards&quot; that it is too convenient to ignore&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- some rifles are more accurate that one MOA and some are less, but one MOA is a pretty conveniently-sized measuring stick for rifle accuracy.  One MOA is pretty darn good for a factory rifle; 2-3 MOA is acceptable accuracy for most factory rifles; just about any half-shot-out rifle ought to be able to deliver 5 MOA; a half-MOA rifle is really quite something; a quarter-MOA rifle is a level that most competitive target rifles don't achieve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- also, one MOA is a usefully-sized measuring stick for shooter accuracy too (when firing prone with iron sights shooting jacket and sling, an intermediate-level shooter will put the vast majority of his shots into a 2-MOA circle; best-in-the-world level shooters can put ten out of ten shots into a 1-MOA circle but this is hard enough that they will savour it!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For what it's worth the next most common angular measurement you will find is the &quot;mil&quot;, which is one part per thousand (the mil is bigger than the MOA, in rough terms a mil is about three MOA).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- if you're measuring your range in metres and your offsets in centimetres, one mil is ten centimetres at 100 metres.  Since a mil is pretty coarse most scopes with mil adjustments have clicks every 0.1 mils, so one 0.1-mil &quot;click&quot; is &quot;one centimetre at 100m&quot;.  Many European hunting scope have adjustment clicks labelled &quot;1cm at 100m&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;" />

What about getting single-focus glasses or contact lenses with a prescription biased to your shooting needs?  I wear contacts only when I shoot iron sighted target rifle, my right lens is half a diopter less than what I need for perfect distance vision so that it is easier for me to see my front sight clearly.

You'll find that when most people say &quot;self defense&quot;, the get really serious about reliability.

A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small &quot;heat shield&quot; has gone missing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Look at the cylinder's &quot;star&quot; at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is &quot;full lockup&quot; - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check for &quot;rotational wiggle&quot;.  A little is OK on S&amp;Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  **UNLOAD** it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a &quot;circle behind a circle&quot;&#xD;&#xA;effect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the &quot;loose rotational lockup&quot; guns (S&amp;W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's&#xD;&#xA;possible to &quot;nudge&quot; the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is&#xD;&#xA;minimal, .003&quot; to .004&quot; optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006&quot; I'd be&#xD;&#xA;unhappy with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's&#xD;&#xA;next &quot;click&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer&#xD;&#xA;bar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light&#xD;&#xA;sideways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger &quot;transfer bar pinch&quot; issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc." />

Text="As a basic rifle for plinking, the Mosin-Nagant is probably unmatched for reliability at it's low price point. Being such a simple rifle, what you need to look for is rather easy to do. After you ensure that the rifle is unloaded and pointed in a safe direction:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Check the serial numbers on the bolt handle, bolt, receiver, and/or barrel to make sure they match. A Mosin might not have all of these serial numbers on these parts, but any numbers it does have on these specific parts should match to ensure proper head-spacing.&#xD;&#xA; - Rotate the bolt handle up and pull it fully rearward, pull the trigger and remove the bolt. Check the barrel for a good shine and note that the reflected light is straight. By this I mean if you look directly down the barrel the reflected light should form an equilateral triangle. As you rotate the barrel, the sides of the the &quot;triangle&quot; should be straight, any curving indicates the barrel is bent  (the more pronounced the curve, the more severe the bend).&#xD;&#xA; - If you are buying a &quot;new&quot; Mosin, directly from a dealer, then it may have cosmoline in the barrel and possibly some soaked into the stock. So don't reject a rifle if the barrel looks a little dirty, but note that the cosmoline may be hiding rust or bulges. However, if buying a used Mosin, it should have been cleaned and no cosmoline should remain.&#xD;&#xA; - On the whole this next point is not a big issue, but to some it matters. Repair of the crown, or counter-boring, is done to a rifle that has received some sort of damage on the muzzle end of the rifle's barrel and is detectable by running your finger around for about an inch inside the muzzle and not feeling any rifling. You may lose a small amount of velocity and accuracy, but it is rather inconsequential. If you prefer a rifle which has not been damaged enough to require repair, then keep looking, there are plenty out there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For tons more info check out [7.62x54r.net][1] (general info), and these forum threads: [this one from calguns.net][2], www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-482070.html , and www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-385289.html (what to look for when buying).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://7.62x54r.net/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?p=6450730" />

The biggest differences are going to be in muzzle velocity and sight radius. A shorter barrel is going to give you a slower muzzle velocity, which means your bullet is going to drop more before it reaches the target (also, when it hits the sound barrier, it will deflect in weird ways). The shorter sight radius is going to make it more difficult to repeatedly line your sights up on a distant target. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, a 2&quot; revolver, properly fired, can hit a 10 inch target at 25 yards all day (in a vice, you'll probably even get good groups).

Start with the feet: shoulder width apart, maybe a little wider, one foot a little further forward than the other.  Knees bent to lower the center of gravity.  Lean your upper body forward a bit to absorb recoil and perhaps a physical impact from your adversary.  Not a radical lean, just enough to put your shoulders over your toes.  Grasp the pistol in a proper two handed grip (a subject for another question).  Extend your arms and bring it up to eye level.  Exactly how your arms are positioned is going to vary depending on your body type and the length of your arms.  Some folks will find it more comfortable to extend both arms as in the isosceles stance, some will lock their primary arm but keep the support bent as in the Chapman stance and some will leave both arms bent as in Weaver.

For the context of this question, I would add to that answer that a true 5.56mm NATO spec chamber is also the best all around chamber for a rifle, be it for hobby, gun games, or fighting guns. Exceptions to this would include shooting extremely long bullets which require custom chambers due to the overall length of the rounds, or chambers from makers like LaRue (Wylde) and Noveske (Mod 0) where their work has proven to be reliable under many extreme conditions." />

These differences account for approximately 137.9 megapascals (20,000 psi) difference in pressure measurements. This means the NATO maximum service pressure of 430 megapascals (62,000 psi) for 5.56mm NATO is reduced by SAAMI to 379.21 megapascals (55,000 psi) for .223 Remington.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast to SAAMI, the standards organization C.I.P. defines the maximum service and proof test pressures of the .223 Remington cartridge equal to the 5.56mm NATO.

The jarring of the slide slamming down on an empty chamber can cause the hammer to follow and the sear nose to crash into the hammer hooks. Your trigger job will last longer if you ease the slide down. Further, the lower lugs on a match fit barrel take a lot of impact when they contact the slide stop, and without the buffering effect of the round feeding into the chamber, you increase wear on your barrel by slamming the slide on an empty chamber.

Also, best to not keep anything else in the pocket that is carrying--make it the &quot;weapon pocket&quot; (don't carry keys, knives, change, etc, in the same pocket). Additionally, often take the pistol to a range and squeeze off the rounds that have been carried in this configuration, or at least swap out the rounds with fresh ones on a relatively frequent basis, especially if you are carrying in a hot and or humid climate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, use common sense with a pocket holster--don't use it with tight clothing (like jeans),or with something flimsy (like nylon shorts) that would easily reveal the silhouette of the weapon.

A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small &quot;heat shield&quot; has gone missing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Look at the cylinder's &quot;star&quot; at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is &quot;full lockup&quot; - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check for &quot;rotational wiggle&quot;.  A little is OK on S&amp;Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  **UNLOAD** it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a &quot;circle behind a circle&quot;&#xD;&#xA;effect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the &quot;loose rotational lockup&quot; guns (S&amp;W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's&#xD;&#xA;possible to &quot;nudge&quot; the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is&#xD;&#xA;minimal, .003&quot; to .004&quot; optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006&quot; I'd be&#xD;&#xA;unhappy with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's&#xD;&#xA;next &quot;click&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer&#xD;&#xA;bar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light&#xD;&#xA;sideways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger &quot;transfer bar pinch&quot; issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc." />

Competition, Carry/Self Defense, Range Plinking, Safe Queen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are looking at an entry level gun with the intent of upgrading, ask some gunsmiths what they recommend.  I know a few that will work on base Colts and Springfields, while others will not work on Kimbers or customer-supplied stripped frames.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a few off-the-shelf 1911s that were upgraded and one has nothing left other than the frame, plunger tube, ejector, slide and main spring housing pin as original with everything else being replaced in one session.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You asked a very loaded question to what can be upgraded and what is fluff?  You will get answers all over the map with none of the answers being wrong or right.  The joys of 1911 ownership is the absolute personalization that one can do to the gun for their personal tastes and uses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good quality (match grade) parts are not cheap, but are worth the premium over their MIM counterparts (IMHO), especially in a high round count gun.  Learning or locating a good gun smith to install these parts is the trick.  You could have the highest quality hammer, sear and disconnecter and if they are fitted wrong, you just wasted time, money and potentially made your gun unsafe.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One shooter's fluff is another shooter's necessity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that being said, if I had an entry level gun that needed upgrading, I would start in this logical progression:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What causes (or fixes) malfunctions and what breaks?  Get a good set of magazines, a quality fitted extractor (get two), make sure the feed ramp is the proper angle and polished.  Make sure the plunger tube is properly staked as is the ejector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make the gun more comfortable to shoot, I would start with good quality trigger and fire control bits.  Bar stock sear, disconnecter, hammer with a good trigger fitted to your hand and acceptable, reliable, safe trigger weight for the use of the gun. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To compliment the trigger, look at the controls – safety, slide stop, grip safety and sights.  Do you need a larger safety?  Single side or ambi?  Does your manual of arms use the slide stop as a slide release and can you use a higher profile stop?  High beaver tail grip safety with memory bump?  What kind of sights?  Higher and narrower with more light around the front sight?  Lo-mount sights?  Black/black or night sights?  Adjustable? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have made the gun more comfortable to shoot and a bit more personalized to the shooter, let's futz around on the accuracy department. Is the original barrel serviceable?  Would simply exchanging the barrel bushing and inspecting the points of lock-up improve the accuracy to a level we expect, or do we need to go the route of an oversized barrel, link and bushing set? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, let's cut up the frame...  Do you want an undercut trigger guard to help your hands get higher on the gun?  Checkering on the front strap and main spring housing – 20, 25 or 30lpi?  Checkering under the trigger guard, back of the slide and/or flat top the slide with serrations?  Finish it off with a set of grips...  G10, wood, rubber?  What level of aggressiveness on the grips?  Rough Gunners or smooth wood?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time for the finish.  What color do you want it and what do you want to protect it from?  Nicks and scratches or holster wear?  Humidity or sweaty hands?  Do you want it pretty in pink or coyote tan to match your khaki pants?  Black goes with everything, unless you want it blued." />

I don't agree with grease as a proper lubricant for firearms.  When grease is used in varied applications, it is in a “closed” system where the migration of the lubricant is limited to the confines of the closed system.  This closed system prevents the contamination from outside sources (dirt, dust, residue of combustion, etc) as these contaminants suspended inside the grease act as a very effective abrasive compound.  As an armorer, I have seen the effects of this abrasive effect on rifles, LMGs and handguns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't agree with CLP or Break Free as “proper” lubricants.  Suspending teflon or the idea of being a 'cleaner' or 'protectant' in the same bottle as a lubricant does not make a proper lube.  Solvents are cleaners, protectants are varnishes and neither belong in the same bottle as a lubricant, no matter the label.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have not found anything as effective, cost-effective or ubiquitous as using synthetic motor oil as a firearm lubricant.  I can spill more than I use and still have plenty of lubed guns with a $7.00 quart of Mobil 1 from Target.  Most “gun lubes” are nothing more than a synth base with inert additives.  Even the ever-popular Miltec 25 is simply a synth gear oil for heavy equipment, packaged and sold (with a significant margin) for the shooting public.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important part of the lubrication process is where you lube, not what you lube with.  While the owner's manual is a good start, asking what lubricants actually do will give you an idea of where to place your lubricant.  “Where do I have metal on metal contact, where do I want to reduce friction, protect against wear due to the reciprocation of parts and where do I want to prevent galling?”  Answering those questions will give you the precise locations of where you should apply your liquid lubricants.  Putting KY Jelly on the corrects parts &gt; putting oil on the wrong parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, liquid lubricants do migrate and evaporate.  It is up to the user to ensure their firearm is properly maintained and serviceable.  That may mean reapplying lubricant at regular intervals even if the gun isn't fired/used.  Grease is a lazy method to decrease that inspection frequency and can significantly decrease the service life of the firearm due to accelerated wear. " />

The datum surface varies by caliber.  On most rimless / rebated rim straight-walled brass it is the case mouth.  On rimmed cartridges it is the forward edge of the rim.  On a belted cartridge, it is the forward edge of the belt, and on most other necked cartridges it is a point on the shoulder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Normally you check headspace, rather than actually measure it.  (That is, you're looking for pass / fail rather than a number).  That said, headspace is checked with a set of two gauges - a 'go' gauge which proves that the chamber will accept a round, and a 'no-go' gauge which proves that the chamber will not chamber an out-of-spec round.  To test, you want to remove any spring-tension, such as might be caused by the ejector in an AR-15 bolt, or the cocking mechanism on an Enfield.  That done, you attempt to close the action on each of the gauges.  The action should close easily on the 'go' gauge, but not close on the 'no go' gauge.  The 'no-go' gauge is the one you normally are concerned with.  If the action closes on a no-go gauge the chamber is too deep.  At best this will result in overly deformed cases during firing, but it could also lead to a case rupture, which can be dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a rifle is found to have excessive headspace (closes on the 'no-go' gauge) it can be 'set back' on most rifles by a gunsmith as long as the chamber is relatively intact.  Some rifles (the AK's come to mind) and most pistols aren't worth the effort and would warrant a barrel replacement." />

There are 7 stations arranged in a semi-circle starting under the high house and rotating around to in front of the low house, with an eighth station centered between the houses.  A shooter progresses from station to station.  At each station you may be required to fire at single birds and doubles (one thrown from each house).  The course finishes in between the houses firing one shot each at birds thrown one at a time from each of the two houses.  A perfect score is 24.  Because a box of shells is 25, it's typical to allow a 'mulligan' - a single opportunity to re-try a shot at the shooters discretion once per round.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trap is a game with a single house downrange of the shooter and five stations that the shooter rotates through.  The stations are close together, so it's a lot like shooting from the same spot.  Bird can fly out at any angle, but due to the position of the house are always some 'going away' shot.  People who shoot trap regularly get to the point where it becomes a competition to see who can stay awake the longest as round after round proceeds before anyone gets bored and misses. ;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sporting Clays is intended to simulate actual bird hunting.  Typical Sporting Clays is run as either 5-stand or 10-stand.  Each stand has a different shooting challenge and if you shoot at multiple clubs you will see tremendous variety.  Stations may be named after the birds they emulate (Teal, grouse, etc.).  You will shoot at clays fling toward you and over your head, straight up, straight across, but visible only between to trees, or a clay and a 'rabbit' (a special thick clay that is bounced along the ground), or a hen shoot (two orange clay targets and a white or yellow target all thrown together - the orange are targets the 'hen' is a penalty if you hit it) and many other imaginative stands.  Due to the variety, sporting clays is easily the most challenging and humbling of the three, but also the most time and resource intensive.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you enjoy shotgun shooting you should try all of them, as each offers something different.

They are usually the product of a mis-fed SAW or a double-fed M4/M16. We have never had an issue with rounds that have not had bullet angle compromised.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can do this in the military because we have quality rifles (Colt M4s, FN Herstal M16s) and use quality ammunition. If your rifle is of questionable specification or low quality (DPMS, Bushmaster, Rock River), or the ammo is not an acceptable quality factory ammo (Tula, Wolf, steel cased) or has an unknown history (reloads you bought from a friend with no idea how many times the brass has been reloaded) then I would advise against shooting it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the crimp is bad enough to get the bullet pointing in a direction that is not straight forward, we toss the rounds and don't use them. Not because they're a safety hazard (although they may be) but because they generally will never feed properly again, which makes them annoying. We also toss rounds that have been so badly damaged that the metal has a hard crease (think like a crease in your pants, not just a dent). Hard-creased rounds have generally been damaged in more places than just the spot where the crease is, and the neck where the bullet seats is often lose and allows the bullet to move if pressed on. Also not good for feeding, and if the bullet falls out it makes a mess of powder and the loose bullet can jam things up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally I wouldn't worry too much about the round having some ill effect on your gun if something bad were to happen at the point of the crimp. The neck of the cartridge and the entire body of the cartridge is supported all around by the chamber of the rifle." />

Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas of such firearms;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firearms automatically attain C&amp;R status when they are 50 years old. Any firearm that is at least 50 years old, and in its original configuration, would qualify as a C&amp;R firearm. It is not necessary for such firearms to be listed in ATF’s C&amp;R list. Therefore, ATF does not generally list firearms in the C&amp;R publication by virtue of their age. However, if you wish for a classification of your particular firearm under categories (b) or (c) above and wish your item to be listed, you may submit the weapon to the Firearms Technology Branch (FTB) for a formal classification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please note that firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act (NFA) may be classified as C&amp;R items, but still may be subject to the provisions of the NFA. If your C&amp;R item is an NFA firearm (e.g., Winchester Trappers) and you desire removal from the NFA status, you must submit it to FTB for evaluation and a formal classification" />

Usually, this autoforward is a result of a confluence of events and manipulations that relieve the spring tension of the slide against the slide stop, the stop lowers and slide moves forward.  Guns that have a relatively weak recoil spring due to wear or design, geometry of the slide stop and slide relief surface, position of the handgun, amount of force used to insert the magazine, and the cleanliness of the operating parts can have an impact to whether a handgun will autoforward or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Due to this confluence of events, I don't see using or expecting a handgun to autoforward as a viable technique during a slide lock reload.  Rather, I see it as a “freebie.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Couple of major problems with the technique:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It isn't reliable.  Changing any of the above conditions above will have a direct impact if the slide will autoforward.  99 out of 100 isn't good enough.  Defeating the slide stop manually or overhand gripping the slide to defeat the slide stop has proven 100% reliable on a significant number of handgun platforms and I trust those techniques significantly more.&#xD;&#xA;2. What do you do when it doesn't happen?  I have seen many shooters who have grown used to this autoforward go into brain fade when it fails.  They would continually slap the floorplate of the now-seated magazine trying to get the slide to autoforward when the simple task of manually defeating the slide stop or overhand gripping the gun would get it up and running in a shorter period of time.&#xD;&#xA;3. Timing.  I have seen (and experienced) handguns autoforward before the magazine is fully seated and locked resulting in the slide going forward on an empty chamber.&#xD;&#xA;  " />

There are usually defeated by the act of pressing the trigger or the grip safety (Schwartz style on Kimber and S&amp;W 1911s)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Disconnector.

Most common on Glocks, a pivoting and spring loaded block that prevents rearward motion of the trigger unless a finger or other object covers the center face of the trigger, defeating the block.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Manual Safety.  A manual switch that prevents rearward travel of the trigger (1911) or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.  Some manual safeties lock the slide as well (1911, Taurus PT92.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grip Safety.  Usually on the backstap of the gun, depressing the grip safety unblocks the trigger or ensures the proper trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Squeeze Cocker.  Exclusively on the HK P7, the squeeze action of the grip safety (cocker) on the front strap cocks the gun and allows it to be fired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Safety Intercept Notch.  A cut in the hammer of DA/SA or SA pistols is a cut in the hammer that is oversized to intercept the hammer in the case of sear failure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Loaded Chamber Indicator.  Visual and possible tactile indication that there is a round chambered.  Most modern handguns will have the extractor geometry (Glock, HK) indicate whether there is a round chambered.  Other firearms may have a separate component doing as such (Springfield XD) while others have have a simple hole in the chamber for visual confirmation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Decocker.  Safely decocks and lowers the hammer from Single Action to Double Action without the need to press the trigger.  Can block the firing pin striker (Beretta 92 series with decock) and/or maintains the integrity of the firing pin safety function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Magazine Disconnect.  Prevents the rearward motion of the trigger or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship when there is no magazine inserted into the gun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To list the Pros and Cons of each style would be an exercise in futility, as the relative value of each safety feature is going to be objective from shooter to shooter.  Most modern firearms are going to have a number of passive safety features that are mandated due to import guidelines or “gun safety” laws in varied jurisdictions.  It would be very difficult to find a modern handgun design that does not incorporate a firing pin safety, disconnector, safety intercept notch (on hammer fired DA/SA handguns).  On guns with light single action only trigger presses (1911, XD, P7), you will be hard-pressed finding a gun without an external safety and/or grip style safety.      " />

I'm not aware of any firearms like this that don't have a manual safety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Double-action revolvers, where a long and heavy trigger pull cocks and then releases the hammer, almost never have safeties, as the long and heavy trigger pull is considered to be enough safety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Single-action revolvers also generally have no safeties, as they are meant to be carried with the hammer down on an empty chamber, so that you would have to manually cock the hammer to fire it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Autoloaders with double-single actions (the hammer can be cocked manually or by the gun's action, giving a single-action pull, or it can be cocked and released by the trigger with a double-action pull) may or may not have a manual safety. They generally have a way to drop the hammer and return it to double-action mode safely (see Sig-Sauer decockers), and some have a manual safety that decocks the hammer and can be left on (such as most Beretta handguns). Double-action only autoloaders, where the trigger is always longer and heavier than a single-action, usually don't have manual safeties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Autoloaders with double-action only or variations on that blur the line a little. True double-action only guns, where the trigger fully cocks and releases the hammer every time, and it can be pulled again without cycling the action, don't usually have safeties for the same reason as double-action revolvers. Newer striker-fired guns like the Glock, M&amp;P, and XD aren't true double action guns as the striker must be cocked for each trigger pull, but the trigger pull is much longer and heaver than single-action guns, if not as much as a true double-action. Because of this, they usually omit the manual safety just like the double-actions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Handgun trainers generally consider these striker-fired guns with no manual safety to be no less safe than any other handgun provided the same basic safety rules are followed. However, some of them (S&amp;W M&amp;P, for example) have an option for a manual safety to satisfy any departments, militaries, or corporations that have policies requiring manual safeties, or individuals that prefer them.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Most of the accidents attributed to the missing safeties on modern handguns were caused by bad holsters or simple negligence during manipulation with the firearm.  &#xD;&#xA;The question whether or not to have to have a manual safety on a handgun depends entirely on the user's shooting and/or carry style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Historically, I think the reason why most of the handguns had manual safeties was simply because gun safety was taught that way in the police/military (and most handguns are developed with law enforcement and military in mind), so it was considered a standard. I think Glock was the first to mass-produce a gun completely without manual safeties (I don't count the &quot;safety&quot; on the trigger) and made it popular. Today, many handgun designs offer the option &quot;with&quot; or &quot;without&quot; a manual safety (e.g. CZ, GP / STI-GP, H&amp;K, ...)." />

If you're worried about range ammo, and you're still using +P+ after this, I would consider reloading +P+ rounds (CAREFULLY), using your spent brass and heavy FMJ to simulate the recoil of your defense rounds.&#xD;&#xA;2. +P+ isn't really necessary in 9mm, you're increase in muzzle velocity/energy will be expended after the bullet exits your target, IOW it's wasted, and a liability for you.&#xD;&#xA;3. after the 1986 Miami Bank Robbery the FBI determined that the ideal defense round would penetrate 12 inches, no more, no less.  So what you're looking for is a round that does just that through a couple layers of clothing and still expands reliably.  Several agents DIED to learn this, so trust it, it didn't come cheap.&#xD;&#xA;4. the box o truth.  http://theboxotruth.com/docs/bot10_2.htm (and don't constrain yourself to just this article, I learned a lot from that site)  You can also set up a similar testing rig with empty milk jugs and ~$15 in lumber, more calcium in your diet, and best of all you will get wet! :)&#xD;&#xA;5.

All three of these calibers, as well as your choice in equipment and allocation of funds are terrible choices for your stated goal of &quot;learning long range shooting.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're willing to invest $5000 in JUST an upper, how much are you willing to spend on a scope? &lt;strong&gt;Quality glass will take you MUCH farther than a high-end rifle&lt;/strong&gt;, and as you upgrade your rifle it's an investment you can carry with you. That's a pretty healthy budget, and I have to wonder how much you've set aside for ammo and training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Very-large-caliber uppers are an extremely niche item, and I'd recommend you use one of the widely available .308 AR-platform guns if you want to learn on a magazine-fed semi-auto.&lt;/strong&gt; In the AR-platform .308 market $5000 can get you a rifle, a &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; scope, an &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; scope mount, a fair amount of ammo and leave you with a couple hundred dollars left to find good training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To speak again about the quality of scopes, if you're shooting at ranges that warrant any of these calibers (a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; of 1000 yards unless you're shooting at armor or material targets, which you're not), a quality scope is not just optional but required. &lt;strong&gt;At these very long ranges the things that make lower quality scopes lower quality will dramatically hinder your ability to get solid and consistent hits.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;I recommend you review this question regarding long range caliber selection: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/516/what-is-a-good-commonly-available-long-range-cartridge/520#520&lt;/strong&gt;. I outlined in my answer there the myriad reasons for selecting an entirely different caliber than the three you've listed. Especially emphasized in my answer there is the ability to practice more. To become proficient at long-range shooting you will need to fire many thousands of rounds, and these three calibers are really only feasible for learning if the ammo is supplied to you at no cost (say, by a police department or the military) or you're independently wealthy." />

In a fixed-power scope there are fewer moving parts and less to go wrong. They usually stand up better to hard impacts and especially hard use. What you give up is the ability to lower magnification and widen your field of view on closer-ranged or moving targets, or enhance the level of detail you're able to see by increasing magnification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fixed power scopes are also less expensive to manufacture because of the decreased number of parts required. Because of this you're able to get a better quality scope for the same price as a lesser-quality variable-power scope. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've never done varmint hunting, so I'm not sure how much movement of the target is involved. Fixed-power scopes at close range can make it hard to quickly acquire a target and easy to lose them if they leave your field of vision. At longer ranges as the target fills less of the scope, this is mitigated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing to keep in mind is that lower-quality, variable-power scopes often will not give you their highest magnification level without distorting the image in some way.

Extract it, and see if the scratch is there.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Alternately, next time you fire the rifle, put a round of ammo directly into the chamber (don't feed it from the magazine).  Extract the round, unfired - if it has a scratch, it is due to the extraction process.  If it is not scratched, chamber it again (directly) and fire it.  If it is now scratched, then the scratch was caused by the firing.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Here are some things that make a rifle more miserable to shoot:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. more muzzle blast (e.g. from a shorter barrel, or a muzzle brake, or choice of cartridge/load that affects muzzle exit pressure).  The rifle doesn't actually hit you any harder, but it can become a pretty big psychological exercise to deal with this and not let it affect you&#xD;&#xA; 2. rifle fit (an extension of the metal butt plate comment).  If a rifle has a hard and pokey bit of the stock that hits you just wrong, it will hurt you more than a rifle that fits your body better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, I have fired a Sako .375 H&amp;H in relative comfort; it's a powerful rifle but it fitted me reasonably well.  It's a handful, but it is not unpleasant nor painful.  But I have a Marlin 336 in .32 Win Special (30-30 equivalent) and the cheekpiece tends to whack my face pretty viciously - it is one of only two rifles I've ever fired that actually hurt me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An interesting exercise to try if you have the opportunity to do this safely - take a .30-06 hunting rifle and from a standing position hold it at waist level horizontally (at &quot;from the hip level&quot;, but hold it like a pendulum and don't rest the butt against you).  When you fire the rifle you'll be amazed at how little recoil there actually is, it just sort of gently pops back a few inches.  But if that rifle is held in such a way that the scope or stock gets a good run at you, it can really hurt.&#xD;&#xA;" />

If you need to shoot, you need to shoot quickly, you need to move quickly and know where the limit is for a given distance and target size.  In other words, if you train to be slow, you will be slow.  This isn't a license to be sloppy and demonstrate poor marksmanship, but rather having acceptable marksmanship in the shortest time possible.  If you are involved in a shooting, medical professionals will not be marking your hits on the threat for score.  Only hits count.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How fast is too fast and how slow is too slow? Through proper practice and training, you will find the tempo that is appropriate for the distance and size.  Think, “Goldilocks,” too fast, too slow, just right.  Work on a target at varied distances with varied tempos. Say, 3, 7 and 10 yds with three distinct shot tempos at each distance.  Shoot a pair with the intended result being two bullets, one hole.  Speed up the tempo to a reasonable cadence, maybe 1.5 sec split time between shots and the third tempo, put your foot on the gas and attempt to fire two rounds as fast as possible.  You will find the proper tempo for your skill level, distance and target size.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is the appropriate sight alignment and sight picture for a given target at X distance?  While the textbook “front sight post centered in the rear sight notch, flat and even across with a crisp front sight focus” may be appropriate for the head shot, trying to put a round between the running lights of your target at 10yds; that same sighting technique may not be appropriate if you are trying to put two rounds high in the chest at 5yds.  That larger target and the shorter distance will allow for more sight “slop” than the further, smaller target. How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same can be said about your trigger manipulation.  Same small target at 10yds, a smooth consistent press to the rear of the trigger, with a surprise break is textbook.  How much time are your burning if you applied the same manipulation technique as the target increases in size and is closer?  Are you minimizing the amount of distance your trigger finger and trigger have to travel by working the reset of your given firearm?  Are you burning time (and adding in margins of error) by having to reacquire the center face of the trigger and/or take up the slack for every follow-up shot?  How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With those two points above, let me reiterate – don't sacrifice practical, combative accuracy for speed.  Only hits count and it is up to you to find that point that your sight speed and trigger speed is “good enough” for the size and distance of the target.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you taking advantage of your body mechanics to most effectively manage or recover from the recoil impulse as you are resetting the trigger and managing your sights?  Does your platform (stance) lower your center of gravity and push it just forward of your toes?  Does your platform allow your firearm return back to target after the recoil impulse to where it was just before the shot broke or are you “muscling” it back to target because you are not taking advantage of your natural point of aim?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is your dominant (trigger) hand high up on the backstrap of the gun and is your support hand getting as much contact on the gun as possible?  Crossed thumbs and/or support index finger on the front of the trigger guard will result in your hand losing contact with the gun, diminishing your ability to recover from recoil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look at the top shooters in the world and they have many things in common and one being highly defined and toned forearms and upper body.  Resulting in a very strong grip without fatigue and larger muscles absorbing the recoil forces. If you are trying to “stabilize” the gun with an ever-tightening grip and those muscle groups fatigue easily, your sight wobble will be worse despite trying to correct for it.  A self-fulfilling prophesy, if you will.  Get yourself a set of kettlebells and look for the “Shooter's Push-up.”  Isolates and works the muscles a shooter needs developed... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Breathe.  In with the good, out with the bad.  Don't hold your breath, your brain will need the fresh oxygen in the blood and when you hold your breath, you are depriving your gray matter of that oxygen resulting in lots of nastiness.  Lot's of good information out there covering “combative breathing.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck reducing those split times." />

This twist rate will stabilize all military and self defense loads, and will only have issues with bullet weights under 50gr.&lt;/strong&gt; Bullet weights under 50gr are nearly exclusive to varmint hunting. A 1:9 barrel will have trouble with loads much heavier than the mid-60gr range, which puts many very effective defense, long range, and hunting loads outside their ability to stabilize.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. &lt;strong&gt;Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber and material(s) can only grow in length as they increase in weight.&lt;/strong&gt; To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bullet stability and twist rate&#xD;&#xA;Twist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (&quot;one-in-seven&quot;) twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability&quot;&gt;Greenhill Formula&lt;/a&gt;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Greenhill Formula&quot; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)&#xD;&#xA; - D = bullet's diameter in inches&#xD;&#xA; - L = bullet's length in inches&#xD;&#xA; - SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. &lt;strong&gt;The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.&lt;/strong&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Early AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior." />

The magazines are new Wilson Combat 7-round for the Officer's grip. There is no shock buffer. I'm wondering why it's only the first round of a full magazine from slide lock. While shooting, the gun has never failed to cycle correctly. I suspect it's that the magazines are slightly dirty, but I wanted to ask here to confirm that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Some early pistols need to be upgraded -- the metal internal components of which typically have a black finish as opposed to the current silver finish. Look under the slide at the bottom of the firing pin lug and firing pin safety; look at the trigger bar inside the frame. If these parts are black in color, the pistol needs an upgrade kit. If the parts are dull or shiny silver, it should be fine. Another way to tell if the pistol was made before the update is that the frame serial number plate will be black as opposed to silver, which is the current configuration. If you buy a pistol that needs upgrading, you can take it to a Glock armorer or send it to the Glock Warranty Department where they will perform all the necessary upgrades at no charge.&#xD;&#xA;" />

In the original 1911 design, the extractor is meant for *controlled feed*  - that means the rim should slide up under the extractor in normal use. As such it doesn't have the range of travel desired for regularly snapping over the rim of a cartridge. The 1911 with an external extractor (like the Dan Wesson models that never worked and the Kimber models that almost worked a little) could snap over a round without risking damage.  Glock extractors are unlikely to be damaged by closing on a chambered round.  You really need to examine the travel of your particular extractor type to make a determination." />

ArmaLite sold the rights to the AR-15 and AR-10 to Colt in 1959. The original design was a select fire weapon that became known as the M-16 when it was adopted by the US Military.

You can either use a heat gun to melt the cosmoline off, or you can soak the parts in solvent for a while. To remove cosmoline from the chamber, use a good solvent with a chamber brush mounted in a power drill (at a fairly slow speed).

The pattern depends on the individual gun, choke, and ammunition (which varies by shot size, weight, manufacturer, etc), and also on things like air temperature and wind. Then there's also the matter of whether the pellets still have enough energy to break the target when they get there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While #8 and #9 have been found to work best by a large number of people, that doesn't mean they'll be what's best for you. It's very likely though that they *will* be good enough to go out and hit some targets and have fun, especially if you're just starting out, so you don't have to get worked up about it right away. However, to find the *best* pattern, you have to try various chokes and types of ammunition in your particular gun. Even between two guns which are identical on paper (same mfgr, model, choke, ammo, etc) there can be differences in patterns, so everyone has to [do their own experimentation](http://www.chuckhawks.com/why_pattern.htm).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can decide for yourself how obsessive you want to get in your research. A good starting point would be to try 3-5 different types of ammo (different shot sizes will give the biggest pattern differences) through 1 or 2 chokes which should give you a sense of what the differences are, what will work for you, and what direction to look if you want to experiment further." />

The best solution is to loctite the bushings in place, and get some thin nylon or fiber washers to put under the grip screws.  If you'd like a thicker grip, as I do, you can put a piece of pond liner (like inner tube rubber, but flat) under the entirety of the grip and that will also do the trick.  A more equipment intensive solution is to counterbore the back side of the grip for a nylon washer." />

Lucky for you, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlylongrange.com/badnews.asp&quot;&gt;such a rifle&lt;/a&gt; exists. The Bad News .338 LM semi-automatic (now available in .300 WM). You won't get closer to keeping the same manual of arms unless you somehow shrunk it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For only uppers available in both .338 LM and .50 BMG, you can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tactilite.com/&quot;&gt;TacLite&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these models also take Accuracy International magazines in the off chance you get an AI bolt-gun in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, in .50 BMG you have the option of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferret50.com/ordering.html&quot;&gt;Ferret 50&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer lowers dedicated to the task of attaching very-large-caliber uppers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following portion of my answer may not be a direct answer to your question but based on the information you've given through question and comments, I can't recommend strongly enough that you reconsider your plan. All three of these calibers, as well as your choice in equipment and allocation of funds are terrible choices for your stated goal of &quot;learning long range shooting.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're willing to invest $5000 in JUST an upper, how much are you willing to spend on a scope? &lt;strong&gt;Quality glass will take you MUCH farther than a high-end rifle&lt;/strong&gt;, and as you upgrade your rifle it's an investment you can carry with you. That's a pretty healthy budget, and I have to wonder how much you've set aside for ammo and training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Very-large-caliber uppers are an extremely niche item, and I'd recommend you use one of the widely available .308 AR-platform guns if you want to learn on a magazine-fed semi-auto.&lt;/strong&gt; In the AR-platform .308 market $5000 can get you a rifle, a &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; scope, an &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; scope mount, a fair amount of ammo and leave you with a couple hundred dollars left to find good training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To speak again about the quality of scopes, if you're shooting at ranges that warrant any of these calibers (a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; of 1000 yards unless you're shooting at armor or material targets, which you're not), a quality scope is not just optional but required. &lt;strong&gt;At these very long ranges the things that make lower quality scopes lower quality will dramatically hinder your ability to get solid and consistent hits.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;I recommend you review this question regarding long range caliber selection: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/516/what-is-a-good-commonly-available-long-range-cartridge/520#520&lt;/strong&gt;. I outlined in my answer there the myriad reasons for selecting an entirely different caliber than the three you've listed. Especially emphasized in my answer there is the ability to practice more. To become proficient at long-range shooting you will need to fire many thousands of rounds, and these three calibers are really only feasible for learning if the ammo is supplied to you at no cost (say, by a police department or the military) or you're independently wealthy." />

It seems there are a pair of small metal rods near the trigger assembly that operate independently but need to be in sync.  They were out of alignment, which is really easy to cause, and it seemed to be causing the failure to feed.  I will try to come back and post a picture - it will show the problem in much greater detail than I could ever describe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: Haven't gotten the picture yet (my camera is broken), but I do have a better description.  These two metal rods are actually part of the same metal coil that, in an AK-74 at least, appear to stop before reaching the trigger assembly, but in the Saiga-12, they seem to both need to rest on top of part of the trigger assembly.  What actually seems to be happening is that the trigger was failing to reset because of this - a new shell would be chambered, but the trigger would not reset so you could not fire without a manual cycle.  Again, I will work on getting pictures.  Supposedly getting a new camera as an early Christmas gift, so that should help. :-)" />

Do you want to actually spend time shooting a firearm?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I typically advise people to find a local NRA Basic course (there are Basic Pistol, Basic Shotgun, and Basic Rifle courses). Many local shooting ranges offer them. Some people complain they are too long for beginners, but for a comprehensive introduction, I like them.

At the complete beginner level, I would steer clear of any class that seems overly concerned with being cool or elite. Talk to the instructor beforehand even over email if that's all you can manage. Ask how the class is run, how they deal with safety, etc. Get a vibe. If you don't click, don't take that class. I do have one concrete warning. Be cautious about anyone saying they &quot;play by big boy rules&quot;. There are several great instructors who use this to mean they follow the widely accepted rules of firearms safety while having a hot range. Unfortunately I've heard of many new training outfits using this same phrase to describe training scenarios that look like an horrible accident waiting to happen. If someone says that, ask them to clarify. If they won't clarify find someone else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.nssf.org/shooting/learn/" />

Run the string from your trap through the eye in the upright and tie it off on the eye on the pedal.  Set the trigger on the trap (thrower) and back the piece off until the string is taut.

Ackley is the one of the definitive experts on wildcatting, considering he was one of the developers of the .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer cartridge (.380 Weatherby Magnum necked down to .224, pushing a 50gn bullet). A good resource would be his *Handbook for Shooters and Reloaders* (volumes 1 and 2).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming your receiver and barrel are made of unobtainium, your biggest concern will be the barrel's twist. @Bryson has a fantastic guide to twist [here.][1] If I'm reading it correctly, given some bullet weight/length, optimal twist increases with muzzle velocity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you've solved for twist, the problem remains of designing a receiver and action that can handle your increased pressure. Falling Block actions tend to be very sturdy, and are therefore unlikely to blow up in your face. I'm not very well versed in metallurgy, but you'll probably want a chamber and barrel milled out of one piece of billet carbon steel. You'll have to throw that out occasionally, because higher pressures will accelerate throat erosion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to increase accuracy at range, you can fiddle with bullet design. Accuracy goes to hell when the bullet crosses the trans-sonic barrier, so decreasing the coefficient of drag and increasing weight (while keeping muzzle velocity constant) increase effective range. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck and don't lose an eye!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://firearms.stackexchange.com/a/282/12" />

This type of mount is more likely to vibrate loose, shift around slightly even when tight, and be difficult to re-mount without losing zero.

Having two or three spares, providing a similar total round count, seems to be relatively common though. Many people recommend having at least one spare magazine (regardless of capacity) just in case your first magazine develops feeding problems. Might only take a couple seconds to clear up normally, but it's not something you want to do under stress.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By carrying a gun in the first place, you're already preparing for something which is fairly unlikely. Fortunately most of us will never need to use a gun to defend ourselves. So you have to decide how unlikely a scenario you want to be prepared for. Keep in mind though that shooting under stress is extremely difficult. Even the police have been in shootouts where 100+ rounds were fired yet no one was hit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it seems to me&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that if you are in a situation that allows you the opportunity to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; safely reload and reengage, you have the opportunity to break contact&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and run - unless you're law enforcement / military and are getting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; paid to be there, this should be your first choice anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Getting out of a gunfight while you're ahead would always the best choice (after avoiding it in the first place), but it may not always be possible. The threat may be between you and the exit preventing your escape. Or retreating might require you to leave a position where you have relatively good cover, putting you in greater danger. Or there may be other people with you such as elderly parents or small children that aren't able to retreat quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, there is no right amount. There are practical limits to what you can carry, and you can never be prepared for every imaginable scenario. Having 2-3 spare normal-capacity magazines is about as much as most people can reasonably manage, and just having a 6+1 with no spares will take care of a lot of possible situations. " />

You change magazines, not because you need more ammo, but because it's the quickest way to bring your pistol back in service.  You're in pretty dire straights if you need 30+ rounds.  While it boils down to opinion &quot;How much is enough&quot; - I carry 8+1 in the gun and a single (8-round) spare magazine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also worth noting that the high capacity (not to be confused with standard capacity) magazines are not usually as reliable as standard capacity, and are therefore a poor choice for carry." />

A few did, however, mention that during or immediately following the confrontation that they had a concern about the amount of ammunition in the gun or if they went to their last and only reload.

The rules get a little fuzzier when it comes to sales - technically, you can sell a gun that you built, but if you are building guns for the purpose of selling them to others, then you need a Type 7 FFL (manufacturing license). The exact line is subject to interpretation by courts and federal agents, so it is generally best to stay as far on the good side as you can.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See the [ATF's Website][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Q: Does the GCA prohibit anyone from making a handgun, shotgun or rifle? &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With certain exceptions a firearm may be made by a non-licensee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; provided it is not for sale and the maker is not prohibited from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possessing firearms. However, a person is prohibited from assembling a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; [18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 479.105]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the wrinkles is that a receiver that is less than 80% complete is not considered a firearm, and so can be built, bought, and sold just like any other chunk of metal. The exact definition of what constitutes 80% complete is similarly fuzzy, but there are multiple companies selling &lt; 80% receivers intended to be finished at home (see [here][2] and [here][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Title 2 items (machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, destructive devices (guns with caliber &gt; .50 and anything involving explosives), and Any Other Weapons), things get more complex. They can all be made, but they must be registered first, before construction. This means that you can make you own suppressors, AOWs, short-barreled rifles, and shotguns under the same rules, but you must have a NFA [Form 1][4] filed and approved with a tax stamp **before** you start construction. It can be sold to another person only under normal NFA rules (the buyer must have an approved form 4 before they can take possession), and with the same provision that if it looks like you are manufacturing for the purpose of sales, then you need the appropriate manufacturing license.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Making machine guns is a special case, because the BATFE will not register machine guns manufactured after 1986 for civilian possession. To register one, and therefore to legally manufacture one, you must be a FFL/SOT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Destructive devices are trickier - I don't personally know anyone manufacturing them, and haven't been able to find any solid information about it online. If you intend to manufacture anything involving explosives or large-caliber weapons, it would be best to ask the BATFE directly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's the legal side. As for the technical side, it is possible to make almost anything at home, given the right tools and equipment. A quality CNC mill and a lathe will cover a lot of bases, and there are plans and forums online in support of fabricating parts for many popular firearms, including 1911 pistols and AR15 rifles. The exact details of what is required depend on the model of firearm, and going into that much detail on metalworking seems beyond the scope of this site (is there a stackexchange site more associated with advanced metalworking/fabrication?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/general.html#gca-manufacturing&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ar15plus.com/default.asp&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.colfaxtactical.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/form1.html" />

Very “Hollywood” but risky.  I have thrown people off my ranges for clearing a gun in that manner.  Clearing a gun, the shooter must have attention to what they are doing and avoid diverted attention.  Ejecting a live round and attempting to catch it, the shooter’s attention is diverted away from the gun and trying to track and catch something relatively harmless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cupping:  Again, a dangerous practice.  The risk to the shooter is the circumstance that the round fails to eject from the port and the primer comes in contact with the ejector, causing an out of battery discharge of the round.  Injurious to the shooter and damage to property. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I subscribe to the philosophy that any administrative handling of firearms should support the combative manipulations.

For the round to go off, something sufficiently pointed would have to strike the primer at approximate center.  The bullet end is heavier, making such an event even less likely.

A .177&quot; pellet (the most common kind), weighs about 10 grains (7000 grains to the pound; 10 grains is 0.65 grams).  You can expect a pellet to leave the muzzle of an air pistol in the neighbourhood of dgm's 400fps figure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By &quot;.22&quot; you probably mean a .22 rimfire.  This cartridge has a 40 grain bullet, which fired from a pistol will have about 1000fps muzzle velocity (from a rifle you'll get about 1250fps).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see the .22 is much more powerful - its bullet is four times as heavy as the pellet, and it is moving 2.5 times as quickly.  This gives it 25 times as much kinetic energy as the pellet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At 10ft, a pellet will embed itself a well into a 3/4&quot; thick softwood board but won't penetrate.  It will easily embed itself in flesh and it would destroy an eye.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At 10ft, the bullet from a .22 will completely penetrate several 3/4&quot; thick software boards and is easily capable of producing a lethal wound.&#xD;&#xA;" />

You don't need to use kid gloves, but don't let the slide slam back into battery, do NOT use a wrist flick to close the cylinder on a revolver, and don't let magazines just drop to the ground unless you've asked or been told it is ok. Finally, be polite. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few specifics to get you started:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When handed a gun, verify it is unloaded, then close the action gently while asking the counter guy for a safe direction for you to point the gun. Keep to that safe direction. Do NOT sweep the counter guy or anyone else.&#xD;&#xA; - Ask about dry firing before doing it. Some places really hate this. &#xD;&#xA; - Ask about field stripping. I think this would be be weird for a new firearm, but probably not for a used one.&#xD;&#xA; - If you can hand it back in a way that makes it easy to verify it's unloaded (cylinder swung out or slide locked back), do so. Follow their lead as far as putting back on the counter. If he holds out a hand, hand it to him.&#xD;&#xA; - You probably won't be able to shoot a new gun, I've also never run into a shop that'll let you shoot a used gun, however some shops will let you quickly rent and shoot an identical model, then apply the rental price towards a purchase if you make one.&#xD;&#xA; - Don't argue. Don't go looking to prove you're smarter, better, more tacticool. If you ask their opinion, accept it. If they offer an opinion you didn't ask for, nod and smile. Even if you're convinced they are wrong, you don't need to correct them, just don't give them your business. If they are doing anything or encouraging anything you consider dangerous, leave.&#xD;&#xA; - If you see another customer doing something dangerous (like sweeping the muzzle around the entire store) tell your counter person. You can say something to the other customer directly or not, that's up to you. If the employees look at you like you're being silly, leave.&#xD;&#xA; - Don't surprise them. If you are currently carrying, don't suddenly present your own firearm. Yes, I saw someone start to do this once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

While your body type may challenge you, look at the whole system of carrying:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Gun:  Get a normal sized gun (yes, I consider a G21 normal sized) that you are comfortable carrying and are proficient with.  I can't see why you can't conceal a G21.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Holster:  A good quality kydex, leather or hybrid inside the waistband holster.  With less waistline, you may want a slight cant (FBI cant of 10 to 20 degrees) of the holster to bring the grip slightly forward on your body as to avoid the &quot;grip print.&quot;  A high rise style holster may help conceal a bit by bringing the grip higher above the belt line.  But, it may be a little slower to draw due to having to bring the hand higher to acquire the final firing grip.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Belt:  A belt designed specifically to carry the weight of a gun and support equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Clothes:  Fit to carry a gun IWB and baggy enough to break up the print of a handgun on your waist.  If you want to wear tight jeans and a ribbed tshirts, they won't go well concealing a G21.  Avoid solid light colors and look for patterns that will break up the print. " />

For me, it's more comfortable than inside the waistband, though opinions differ. I wear my holster behind my hip (4:30-5 o'clock), with a pretty serious forward cant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only difficulty here is that you have to wear shirts that come down past the bottom of the holster and won't rise up past it. If you live in a state that allows concealed carry but not open carry (like Texas, off the top of my head), you'll want to be especially careful about this, because they consider open carrying 'brandishing'. You'll also want shirts that are a little baggy, to hide the 'grip print' Ray J mentioned. For me, it's an excuse to wear button-up shirts, which I think look nice anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No matter where you carry, it's absolutely critical to practice drawing it until it's second nature.

You need to make up your mind on what you want to use for lubricants. You can't buy that goo glock distributes with their new guns so I take it all off with rubbing alcohol and then replace it with TW25. Then I just clean the frame rails with lightly soaked Ballistol (penetrating lubricant and cleaner) rags and reapply TW25 as needed to the slide rail channels. TW25 doesn't run either so you can easily apply it to the trigger bar like the manual says and it won't run down into your frame. A drop of that in the locking block area is good too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's really it, any other lubrication point is optional, some people like to put a little grease on the top side of the barrel. It's really up to you. &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;qtips are great for detail work, so are pipe cleaners albeit a little more expensive. The later bits are necessary though when you break down the rear of the slide and service the striker channel and other spring loaded channels. NO LUBRICANT THERE, the plastic and the metal finish is sufficient. Do that about once a year or 5000 rounds, whichever comes first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you still need a hand getting through the basic field stripping/re-assembly process.

People shoot .22 because (among other reasons) it's inexpensive.  The cheapest brands (Remington bulk boxes come to mind) will unfailingly have about 1% duds.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Magazines are probably the second biggest issue.  Being a rimmed cartridge it's harder to make a quality magazine for a .22.  Ruger has done quite well, and some of the 1911 conversions (TacSol and Marvel) have also made very reliable magazines.  Many aftermarket magazines do not perform well.  If you're using multiple magazines, number them and take note of the mag in use whenever there's a malfunction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dirt.  The .22 is a dirty round.  A bit less so when you use the quality stuff, but it's still much messier than any centerfire ammunition.  .22's often run best pretty dry, to prevent accumulation of debris.  When the Akins Accelerator was still being sold (a full-auto mechanism) the manufacturer recommended a teflon-based dry lube (Liquid Wrench, etc. - available in home stores).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, there's the firearm in question.  If you don't have 500 rounds through it, don't do anything (other than cleaning and light lube) until you reach that mark.  After that you might take a piece of crocus cloth and polish up any of the areas where you see wear.  This should smooth things out considerably, and was a necessary step to get one of my Ceiner .22 conversions to work.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If none of that fixes the problem, send it back." />

Just coat the inside of the barrel with the CLP, wait a few seconds, then run the snake through it a few times. If you've got really tough fouling, use some heavier solvent and a brass bore brush then follow up with the clp and snake.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't like to use CLP on any other part of the 1911. I prefer to just use a penetrating oil that can build up over time. This means a bit more elbow grease trying to get the grime off, but that's acceptable. I'll talk about lubrication in a second.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wipe down the outside of the barrel with a cloth that won't leave lint. I actually really like those microfiber cloths that you use to clean monitors (see if you can pick some up in a bargain bin at an electronics store).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the slide, pay close attention to the rails and the space under the hook of the extractor. Scrub the rails with a soft gun brush - not a brass one - and use a cotton swab to pull out the loosened carbon. Be sure to inspect closely for any loose strands of cotton. Use the brush to make sure there is no carbon built up under the extractor. Any other buildup should be clear to the naked eye and easy to clean out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the frame, focus again on the other set of rails and use the same method described above. Don't forget the feed ramp! Anything else, again, should be pretty plain to see.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Be sure not to ignore the recoil spring. Inspect it and wipe off any gunk you find.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For lubricant, I like to use MILITEC-1. It will build up in the metal over time and makes the action of the 1911 smooth as glass whether you run it wet or dry. Set the slide straight up on a flat surface, apply a drop of MILITEC to the back of each rail and let it drip down. Apply a moderate amount of oil to the barrel and work it over the whole surface with your fingers. Don't let any of this oil find its way into the bore! You shouldn't leave an excess of oil on the surface of the barrel, but I like to keep it a little wet. Use a small amount of oil on the spring and work it over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Series 80 1911s, there's a small &quot;nub&quot; on the frame just forward of the hammer that's a part of the firing pin block. Push down on it and slowly let the spring push it back up. If its movement feels grainy or sticky, put a small drop of oil on it and work it up and down until it moves smoothly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the slide stop was difficult to extract, apply a tiny amount of oil to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's everything off the top of my head. You usually won't *need* to detail strip a 1911, but it can't hurt to do it a few times throughout the life of the gun. I'll let someone more familiar with the process describe that part." />

The 1911 is an easy gun to detail strip and while the described cleaning protocol works well for 90+% of the gun's needs, there are times a detail strip is a good idea:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Use of dirty ammo&#xD;&#xA; 2. Dirty environment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those two conditions will result in fouling in places that you can't reach in the normal cleaning and it is a good idea to strip it all the way down to clean and inspect the small parts at times.  When I lived in the southwest (Las Vegas) desert and spent a vast majority of the time shooting outdoors, the fine dust and sand always found its way into the nooks and crannies of my guns.  My rule of thumb is that any time I changed springs (recoil, firing pin and to a lesser frequency, the mainspring) I detail stripped it and did a thorough cleaning.

I want to buy a firearm from the US and have it sent to me in Canada.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A1. Any holder of a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) may import a restricted or non-restricted firearm, depending on the limitations of their PAL. However, the US control the export of most firearms (antiques and muzzle-loaders are not controlled for export) and the US must issue an export licence to the American exporter. Prior to issuing this licence the US government requires that the Canadian importer present a document from Canada allowing this proposed transaction. To satisfy that US requirement Canadian residents may apply for an International Import Certificate (IIC).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following steps are involved;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1.  have the US seller identify the exporter - the US government requires that this exporter be a Federal Firearms Licenced (FFL) gun dealer for most exports. In many cases the US seller is an FFL dealer.  yedit from RayJ:  &#xD;&#xA;http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   2.  apply to Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT) for an International Import Certificate (IIC) by calling (613) 996-2387 or by faxing your request to (613) 996-9933 and requesting blank application forms. Once completed, the form should be returned to ITCan for processing and certification. Expect this process to take 2-3 weeks. The certified document will then be returned to the applicant for onward delivery to the US exporter. There is no charge for the IIC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   3.  pre-register the firearm through the Canada Firearms Centre.

I want to buy a firearm from the US and have it sent to me in Canada.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A1. Any holder of a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) may import a restricted or non-restricted firearm, depending on the limitations of their PAL. However, the US control the export of most firearms (antiques and muzzle-loaders are not controlled for export) and the US must issue an export licence to the American exporter. Prior to issuing this licence the US government requires that the Canadian importer present a document from Canada allowing this proposed transaction. To satisfy that US requirement Canadian residents may apply for an International Import Certificate (IIC).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following steps are involved;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1.  have the US seller identify the exporter - the US government requires that this exporter be a Federal Firearms Licenced (FFL) gun dealer for most exports. In many cases the US seller is an FFL dealer.  yedit from RayJ:  &#xD;&#xA;http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   2.  apply to Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT) for an International Import Certificate (IIC) by calling (613) 996-2387 or by faxing your request to (613) 996-9933 and requesting blank application forms. Once completed, the form should be returned to ITCan for processing and certification. Expect this process to take 2-3 weeks. The certified document will then be returned to the applicant for onward delivery to the US exporter. There is no charge for the IIC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   3.  pre-register the firearm through the Canada Firearms Centre. Pre-registration allows the importer to clear the firearm through the Canada Border Service Agency without any undue delay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   4.  the US exporter will attach their copy of the IIC to their application for an export licence. In the US, applications for shotguns are administered by the Department of Commerce and for all other firearms are administered by the Department of State.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   5.  once the US export licence is issued the US exporter may then send the firearm to Canada.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   6.  the Canadian importer is responsible for declaring the value of the firearm to Canada Customs and for ensuring that all safe storage and safe transportation regulations are observed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   7.  within 30 days of arrival in Canada, the importer must have the firearm verified and such verification confirmed with the Canada Firearms Centre.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a company that does exporting of firearms to canada:  &#xD;&#xA;https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopcontent.asp?type=importsteps  Steps are at the link.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1.  Find a US Vendor who is selling the firearm you want to buy... can be either a business or a private individual or a US auction site like GunBroker.com... arrange a tentative purchase... and tell your US Vendor that you will be using Questar International as your &quot;US FFL Transfer Dealer&quot;.  That is the key phrase... this way they won't be worried about export issues or the fact that you are a Canadian... since we are a US FFL holder your vendor is simply doing a regular domestic sale and shipping to another US dealer.  (The process is the same for parts and accessories... fees change slightly - see #3 below).&#xD;&#xA;   2.  Use our on-line 3rd Party Purchase Order Form to supply us with the information required to do your paperwork and handle your import/export for you...&#xD;&#xA;          *  Answer all of the questions and include detailed info...otherwise your permit may be delayed or denied;&#xD;&#xA;          *  Your current PAL is mandatory... we do NOT do business with anyone who does not have a PAL;&#xD;&#xA;          *  Details about the firearm(s) being imported (make, model, serial number, type of gun {shotgun, semi-auto pistol, revolver, bolt rifle, etc.}, caliber, barrel length, US Purchase Price, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;          *  Name, address, e-mail, phone # and fax # for the current U.S. owner/seller;&#xD;&#xA;          *  If firearm will not be &quot;stored&quot; at your home address then we'll need the storage address for CFC...  (your storage address CANNOT be a P.O. Box - CFC won't accept that);&#xD;&#xA;          *  CFC wants a &quot;stated purpose&quot; for the firearm (&quot;hunting&quot; or &quot;collecting&quot; or &quot;target/competition shooting&quot;);&#xD;&#xA;          *  For Non-Restricted firearms CFC requires that we enter your Place of Birth to do the on-line transfer;&#xD;&#xA;          *  For &quot;Restricted&quot; firearms CFC requires that we give them the name of your &quot;Gun Club&quot; the Club Membership Number and/or your LT-ATT#;&#xD;&#xA;          *  We will require that you scan and email or fax to us an &quot;End User/Purchaser Statement&quot; (use the link to download) leave the IIC # blank and complete the rest. We can't process your export permit without this document;&#xD;&#xA;   3.  Finalize payment of the applicable Import Service Fee;&#xD;&#xA;   4.  Questar will fax / e-mail a copy of our U.S. FFL (Federal Firearms License) to your U.S. seller.  The address of our US office is on the FFL we send them and it is that info that US law requires them to use... they can't ship based on verbal directions... they legally can only ship to the address shown on the FFL we send them;&#xD;&#xA;   5.  You pay your US Seller for the firearm and arrange for them to ship (prepaid) the firearm to the address on our U.S. Federal Firearms License.  (If you want delivery confirmation then please arrange with your US Vendor to send you the tracking data... this can easily be done at time of shipment... we do not give progress reports).&#xD;&#xA;   6.  We apply for your IIC (International Import Certificate).  Ottawa is currently taking 1 to 5 weeks to approve IIC applications...  there is no real average timeframe.&#xD;&#xA;   7.  We then compile all of the paperwork, transfer it to our US office and your US Export Permit application is then submitted to US State Department for approval... It usually takes 6 to 10 weeks for them to review and approve the application...  (about 8 to 12 weeks for the overall process);&#xD;&#xA;   8.  Once all required permits are approved and received we then arrange to transport the firearm(s) to Canada and clear the shipment through Canada Customs (you will be responsible for payment of any duty and/or taxes levied by Canada Customs on your imports).&#xD;&#xA;   9.  We will then verify and register your firearm(s) into the CFC database.&#xD;&#xA;  10.  Firearm Marking Requirements legislation has been postponed until December 1st 2009&#xD;&#xA;  11.  We'll send you a Disbursements Invoice for any duty, taxes and final shipping costs applicable on your imported firearm... when payment has been received, we will arrange for the firearm to be transferred to your name.&#xD;&#xA;  12.  We will then arrange final shipment of the firearm to you.  Please be aware that Canada Post now requires that ALL FIREARMS be shipped via Expedited Parcel, adult signature required, no safe drop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMPORTANT:  It is impossible for us to give customers step by step updates on the &quot;progress&quot; of their import.  Many customers call or email us asking &quot;has my gun arrived yet at your US office&quot; or &quot;has my export permit been approved yet&quot; or &quot;when will my gun get here&quot; or &quot;is it here yet&quot;?  While we understand that you're just anxious and excited, we need you to understand that it's physically and economically impossible for us to answer those questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At any given time we're handling 50 to 100 customer importations and we simply don't have the staff to answer everyone's constant inquiries.  It's like kids in the car asking &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;... only in our car there are over 100 kids asking us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to track the arrival of your purchase to our US office then ask your Vendor to insure that the shipment has tracking details (or delivery confirmation) and that he sends you copies of the tracking info on the shipment, that way you'll know that it did arrive at our office and when. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the export paperwork is approved we'll schedule transport across the border and we will contact you when your gun arrives in Canada and is being entered into the CFC database... at that time you'll be sent your Disbursements Invoice and final arrangements for transfer and shipment will be made.  Until then please understand that we simply don't have the personnel to supply progress reports.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your understanding and co-operation is greatly appreciated." />

In terms of handgun ammunition, the most common measure I've seen to distinguish the relative efficacy of one cartridge versus another is knock-down power, which is a product of the muzzle energy, external, and terminal ballistics.  Given that 357 SIG and 357 Mag use the same diameter bullets (indeed, they can use the *exact same* bullets), for the sake of argument we can ignore the questions of external and terminal ballistics and focus just on muzzle energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Muzzle energy is a computation taking into account the weight of the bullet and the speed at which it's travelling when it leaves the muzzle.  I went to CheaperThanDirt.com and looked up the muzzle energy values for the top six most popular loads in each caliber. The average muzzle energy for the two cartridges: 357 SIG is **501.23 ft-lbs**, 357 Mag loads is **469.56 ft-lbs**.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this is a reflection of what are the most popular items sold at CheaperThanDirt.com right now (and customer preferences can certainly change).  The greater case capacity of the 357 magnum certainly makes it possible to load it to shoot with more muzzle energy than a 357 SIG, but that doesn't mean that one can make a the general statement that one is ballistically superior to the other." />

You have a couple questions here, and many implied questions as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The Lower Receiver &amp; Kit:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets start with the &quot;kit&quot;.  What kind is it?  Where did you order it from (links would be good)?  Typically, when you build an AR, you look at an upper receiver and lower receiver.  You will need a lower parts kit (sometimes called an LPK).  It contains the small components that fit into the trigger assembly and lower receiver (Safety, etc), and you will **definitely** need it.  Here is one from a reputable seller online:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/palmetto-state-armory-gen-2-moe-lpk.html&#xD;&#xA;![LPK from Palmetto State Armory retailer][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That covers most of the Lower Receiver.  I'm glossing over a lot here, but the basics hold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;**The Upper Receiver:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Familiarize yourself with the Bolt Carrier Group and upper receiver portions of your AR.  AR's come in two variants:  Piston-driven and Direct Impingement (sometimes called &quot;DI&quot;).  Essentially, the two differ in how to handle the hot gas that your gun uses when it discharges a cartridge.  Without complicating things further in this thread, here is a quick and short video showing how the two operate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7GTZ0DixqA&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This sort of information (knowing your Lower, Upper, LPK and DI or Piston) are sort of the basics you'll need to know at some point.  The most common AR build is chambered in 5.56/.223 Rem.  I've seen some that are 7.62/.308 Win as well.  Your's is likely .223 or 5.56.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before you even consider firing a round in the rifle, **make sure you know the gun inside and out** (you'll have to know most of it, since you'll be assembling it).  Not all uppers can fire 5.56 NATO cartridges when they are stamped .223 Remington.  This is due to the pressure differences the rifle will undergo on a 5.56 NATO cartridge vs the .223 Remington round.  However, if your rifle is stamped for 5.56 you can shoot any .223 and not have to worry.  I could go off on a tangent about the Throat leade in a .223 vs 5.56 rifle, but I'll refer you to this article first: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2677734/posts &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suffice to say, stick with whatever ammunition your upper tells you to use.  Read the manual :-).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I learned most of what I know by browsing the forums of a well respected gun-community called CalGuns (http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/index.php).  There are tons of &quot;how tos&quot; posted there, as well as deep information on ARs, components, parts, etc.  I'll plug them here since they've been a positive force in the gun ownership community, and taught me basically everything I know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't recommend building an AR from scratch if this is your first gun.  Don't get me wrong, they're great rifles and work well when properly maintained, but to have never owned a gun and jump into it by building an AR might be a bit overwhelming, and you do not want to make mistakes.  If you can, friend a local gun shop (buy your ammo from them or any accessories, the AR is the barbie doll of the gun world, with a million and one useless accessories ;-)).  Friend the gun shop, then go in and discuss your AR, questions you have, etc.  If it's a good shop, they'll help you out because they realize you'll be in later to buy items for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps, and congratulations on becoming a gun owner!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wQ0OU.jpg" />

Try to progress to a piece of black tape on the lens of your shooting glasses (non-dominant side only, of course) and then a piece of scotch tape.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing you will find, particularly when using iron sights is that a small change to the angle at which you hold your head can make a significant difference.  Play with the idea, but don't rush it - it comes with repetition more than experimentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you can remove the scotch tape and shoot with both eyes open you are at your best for shooting (and photography).  The vision in your dominant eye will be at its most acute.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When one eye is closed there is strain in the muscles that focus the eye and the open eye dilates to collect more light.  Of course you also lose some depth perception - all of which are detrimental.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.google.com/search?q=finding%20eye%20dominance" />

Chief among them is cost.  The cost of lead-free ammo is substantially more than that of lead based ammo.  This alone, and chiefly has delayed widespread adoption of lead-free bullets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Extensive&quot; is an ambiguous term, but I have used several types of lead-free bullet and there are certainly differences in performance.  On the plus side, lead-free solids achieve greater penetration and are capable of excellent accuracy.  Being constructed from homogenous material, they do not suffer inconsistencies in center of gravity as jacketed or multi-material bullets may.  On the other hand lead is a difficult metal to compete with, for density and malleability (both important, especially for hunting bullets) and most alternate materials are not as heavy (has negative impact on accuracy potential) and will not expand and retain mass as well, which is important in achieving best terminal performance - &quot;stopping power&quot;).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A final issue (in the US) is our ridiculous ban on &quot;armor piercing ammunition&quot;.  This ban (which declares bullets to be &quot;armor piercing&quot; if they contain the wrong materials and can be used in a pistol) prevent a lot of solutions from coming to market.

Much like spray painting something with a rattle can, it's consistent, overlapping strokes that result in an overall consistent beaded finish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would not sandblast any plastic or wood parts without understanding the effect of the blasting.  It will erode both materials pretty rapidly.  I would also avoid sandblasting the barrel crown or chamber.  The parts you absolutely should not sandblast are your sear surfaces - this is the only instance I can think of that is a matter of safety.  Other trigger components will generally be unimproved by blasting as they function best with a smooth finish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Make sure you're able to completely remove the 'sand' from anything you've blasted.

Easy enough to do, providing your grip incorporates a slight cant of the gun to bring the sights to your dominant eye focal plane.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.	Shoot dominant hand side and aim with non-dominant eye.  A little tougher, as your dominant eye wants to take over.  Instead of blinking/squinting or closing your “other” eye, use the bridge of your nose to block your dominant eye by turning your head ever so slightly.  Slightly blocking your dominant eye with the bridge of your nose will bring your non dominant eye to the sights much more naturally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please don’t close one eye.

When a spring is compressed, it is subjected to &quot;**creep**.&quot; To quote [this article][1], &quot;With most of the engineering alloys used in construction at room temperature or lower, creep strain is so small at working loads that it can safely be ignored. It does not become significant until the stress intensity is approaching the fracture failure strength.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a spring is worked again and again, it is subject to **fatigue** ([article][2]), which manifests as tiny cracks developing in the material. Fatigue is what causes springs to lose their elasticity and eventually break. That's why people worry about the round count on a gun -- the more rounds that have been through it, the more fatigue, and therefore the worse the springs are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html" />

Technically, your 1911 would last longer cocked and locked than if you unloaded and decocked it every night.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Practical consideration: if it's your carry weapon, you'll want to clean and lube it every week or so to make sure it's in good shape, and you'll want to take it to the range at least monthly to keep your skills up and make sure the gun functions. Even a cheap 1911 should last 10,000+ rounds with basic maintenance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it came up in comments below, I'll explain why. When a spring is compressed, it is subjected to &quot;**creep**.&quot; To quote [this article][1], &quot;With most of the engineering alloys used in construction at room temperature or lower, creep strain is so small at working loads that it can safely be ignored. It does not become significant until the stress intensity is approaching the fracture failure strength.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a spring is worked again and again, it is subject to **fatigue** ([article][2]), which manifests as tiny cracks developing in the material. Fatigue is what causes springs to lose their elasticity and eventually break. That's why people worry about the round count on a gun -- the more rounds that have been through it, the more fatigue, and therefore the worse the springs are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html" />

I'll take a first stab.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every cartridge has a proper name that includes more than just the caliber. The name &quot;9mm NATO&quot; means more than a 9mm caliber (aka bullet diameter) bullet. The proper name implies various important dimensions of the entire cartridge like overall length, case length, neck diameter, and maximum pressures during firing. A firearm designed to fire 9mm NATO will be designed around all these specifications. So, if you're looking to buy ammunition for a particular firearm, check to see what the firearm is designed for and match that name exactly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, there is are a lot of similar terms for the same cartridge and also similar sounding terms for different cartridges. Here's my list:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **9x19mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19mm, 9mm long.** This is one of the most common handgun cartridges on the planet. When talking about handguns, if someone says &quot;a 9mm&quot;, he probably means this. But it's always wise to be specific before loading &quot;a 9&quot; cartridge into a &quot;a 9&quot; handgun. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **9mm NATO.** Nearly identical to the 9x19 Parabellum, but the spec allows for a bit more pressure. Before firing, be sure a given gun is designed for 9mm NATO and not just 9mm Luger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **9mm Kurz, 9mm Short. .380 ACP, .380 Auto, 9x17mm, 9mm Browning Short.** A completely different handgun cartridge often used by smaller &quot;pocket&quot; guns. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **9mm Browning Long, 9x20mm.** A rare (I don't think anyone produces this ammunition commercially or even guns to fire it) handgun cartridge.

Depending on what you're doing each of these might make sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Caliber: is how most cartridge collectors organize their cartridges due to disputes in the other methodologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Velocity: is important to most shooters, but perhaps a key scale to target shooters who aren't concerned with terminal performance.  (Of course they're also concerned with the bullets ballistic coefficient...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Momentum: is a scale to those in the 'mass is most important in terminal ballistics' school of thought.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Energy: is the scale to the 'shock effect' school of thought in terminal ballistics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some principle rifle cartridges in the US in quasi-ranking of power:  (velocities listed are representative, but differing loads and bullet weights will go either way).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. 22 LR - rimfire, small bullet, low (~ 1200 fps) velocity&#xD;&#xA;2. 30-30 - a .30 cal bullet, still lower velocity.  An old black-powder cartridge it's name means a 30 caliber bullet propelled by 30 grains of black powder.&#xD;&#xA;3. .223 - our common military small bore, high velocity cartridge.  Pretty high energy, particularly for a tiny bullet. velocities ~3000 fps varying with bullet weight.&#xD;&#xA;4. .308 - our former small arms weapon caliber, and a popular hunting round good for most, if not all, North American big game.  A .30 caliber bullet at velocities of ~2600 fps. Very comparable to the less common .300 Savage.&#xD;&#xA;5. .30-06 (The name meaning .30 caliber developed in 1906).  Another old military cartridge.  Uses a longer, heavier action than the .308 with only small gains in velocity.  Think .30 bullet at ~2800 fps.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of cartridges that have been based on the venerable '06 (pronounced &quot;ought six&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;7. .45-70 Another old black-powder cartridge meaning a .45 caliber bullet with 70 grains of black powder, this is a big beast and commonly associated with the old buffalo hunters.  A modern sibling is the 450 Marlin.  It launches a very heavy, large slug at pretty good velocities (~1800 fps).  &#xD;&#xA;8. .458 Winchester Another big bore, probably the most common heavy game (think Africa) cartridge that's frequently seen in the US.  A thumper to be sure.&#xD;&#xA;9. .50 BMG - a scaled up (1.667x) version of the .30-06, originally designed for heavy machine guns (and still used for such) but now popular for long range target shooting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are necessarily many omissions in the above list (including some popular foreign calibers like the 7.62x39 and 7.62x54R) and again, the velocities listed are for comparison you can find examples of higher velocities in any of those calibers." />

A good example of ammunition that is “most likely to fail” is Winchester White Box (WWB). This rare failure is too low a percentage to make an issue, however it is one we are well aware of. The fix to resolve this issue is quite simple:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clean and lube your slide and barrel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shoot 1 mag to 1 box of good quality +P or +P+ ammunition through the barrel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try the FTF ammunition again. If it runs... great!  If you experience more failures you will have a couple choices to make:&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the recoil spring weight to 11 lbs. Cost is about $25 for stainless steel guide rod and reduced power spring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shoot 124 gr or a better quality 115 gr ammunition exclusively. The FTF 115 gr ammunition you are currently using is no longer a valid option.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;What causes this problem? Several issues come into play:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 40 slide and (40 conversion) barrel are thicker than standard 9mm slides and barrels. This extra thickness equates to more weight. The combined extra weight taps the energy of the &quot;weak 115 gr ammunition” to its complete demise. It simply lacks in power and fails to reliably eject the spent round.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every once in awhile a Failure To Feed/Failure To Eject (FTF/FTE) is caused by a fit issue. We resolve fit issues by pumping +P or +P+ ammunition through the gun. This hot ammunition provides extra pressure and the pressure will positively align any and all components. Once they are all aligned there is no longer a fit issue. The FTF/FTE is usually resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;FYI: Several manufactures are currently producing low powered 115 gr 9mm loads. This ammunition is also known to produce failures in all standard model Glock 9mm pistols.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" />

The proper name implies various important dimensions of the entire cartridge like overall length, case length, neck diameter, and maximum pressures during firing.

A reticle design you like.  It may be simple crosshairs or have some features for helping you lead a moving target, determine range, or compensate for range.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Magnification.  For 2-300 yards I wouldn't go above 4x unless you're strictly bench shooting.  (Because of #3)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Field of view.  The downside to higher magnification is that you can see less in the scope, so you can concentrate really hard on that big, well-magnified 'X' and put a perfect shot onto your neighbor's target, because you couldn't see the target number.  Similarly you can get a field of fur and not know what part of an animal the crosshairs are on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Clarity.  You just have to look through the scope and see how clear the image is.  Pay attention to what the image looks like close to the edge of the scope - that's where poor optics will let you down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Light gathering.  If you have a chance, compare some optics at dusk or dawn.  One of the things that separates really good optics from other contenders is their ability to make the most of very little light.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Adjustments.  If you plan to shoot close to long range (both) target style adjustment knobs as well as fine (`1/4MOA) adjustments are nice.  For 100-300 yards 1/2MOA is fine.  (If you want fine adjustment buy a nicer scope - less expensive scopes that have fine adjustment frequently do not track consistently).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Brand.  I know brand really isn't a feature, but it is a sort of guarantee.  The name brands are guaranteed to be acceptable quality.  A lot of 'budget' makers have entered the market in recent years and they can be hit or miss at best.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. Adjustment precision.  Here's one you probably won't get to try until you've decided.  If you want to evaluate how well a scope's adjustments work you can shoot a 'box' - shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope 3 MOA right, shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope 3 MOA down, shoot a 3-shot group, adjust your scope  3 MOA left, shoot a 3-shot group.  Adjust your scope 3 MOA up and shoot a final 3-shot group.  A perfect scope (and competent shooter) should have a six-shot group and a perfect square made by the other 3-shot groups.  It's normally the 3rd and 4th groups that stray in a poor scope." />

It is quite straightforward to shoot a .223 out to 600 yards/metres and get results good enough to enjoy the shooting.  And with the right preparation and planning (mostly in the choice of barrel twist rate, and the bullet used), one can shoot a .223 out to 1000 yards, in competition, and get results good enough to win regional or national rife matches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of my shooting is done on rifle ranges so this answer will be based on the kind of shooting that I do most (firing prone, with the rifle supported either by a rest/bipod or by a shooting jacket and sling, at 300 500 600 900 and 1000 yards).  I have done a bit of standing shooting too but I find that my rifle moves around much more that way ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For target shooting, with a well-supported rifle, more magnification always seems to be welcome (I've used 20X and 24X scopes and I've always wanted more; some of the top shooters these days are using 42X scopes).  I find that magnification needed/desired does not change with range - if the style of shooting (well-rested prone shooting, in my case) finds that 30X is useful at 600 yards, it'll also find 30X to be just as useful at 100yards (e.g. testing ammo) or at 1000 yards.  If you want to shoot standing, or other sorts of &quot;field&quot; shooting, you will benefit from having a lower power scope or a variable power scope.  As Gene mentioned there is a direct field-of-view vs. magnification tradeoff to be made.  I have shot at 800 yards with a 4X scope and things look so small you can't figure how it is that you are able to hit the target every time (but you can!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For target shooting, most shooters seem to choose very fine reticles, to allow them greater precision in aiming.  A very fine dot, or very fine crosshair, are some of the more common choices.  Myself I prefer very heavy reticles, even when using very high magnification scopes for high precision target shooting (I find that a thick reticle is always easily visible, and even if the reticle is substantially larger than the size of the area you wish to place your bullets in, you can nevertheless aim to a much finer degree than the size of your reticle).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both of the rifles you are considering are good choices.  Of the two I would choose the Tikka, they are one of the best out of the box factory rifles.  Not that you asked me but there are also some very good rifles made by Savage too (especially if you are looking for a factory rifle capable of competitively shooting 1000y).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In case you don't know this, most provinces have Provincial Rifle Associations which enjoy free access to DND (military) ranges and offer very nice outdoor shooting programs from May to September every year, with shooting from 300y to 600y (and in some places to 1000y).  If you're interested in that sort of thing, let me know what province you're in and I can send you some more info.&#xD;&#xA;" />

An IER scope has an extended range over which the target appears in focus compared to a standard scope.  This makes presentation (bringing the scope to the line of sight) a bit less critical.  Combined with the location on the rifle, which lets the eye track the scope into place better and you can snap the rifle into your shoulder and onto target faster than with a conventional scope.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An additional advantage (at least to hunters who carry their rifles any distance) is that it moves the scope forward of the point at which the rifle balances, allowing the user to grasp the rifle at the point of balance - the most natural way to carry it for extended periods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IER designs are not well suited to high magnification.  This isn't much of a disadvantage as that's not what they were designed for.  Another 'disadvantage' that really isn't inherent in the scope itself is just that many rifles do not have a means of mounting such a scope in the proper location.

This cartridge is an A10 designed Automatic Rifle Cartridge is Also Known As 308 Winchester for non military chamber rifles with 100 to 220 grain weight bullets available.

The 300aac blackout is a .308 Diameter bullet in a 5.56/223 CASE that is cut down, shouldered to 35mm Length,Case Neck formed to fit the chambe's shoulder thus a 7.63x35mm CARTRIDGE. A .308 bullet diameter to pass through a .300 rifle bore that accomidates the rifling grove diameter to allow the bullet to pass through.  Light bullets need a SLOW twist like 1:12 for 50 graine an lighter bullets in the 5.56/223. 30 caliber bullets use 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, to stabilize heavy bullets 150 to 220 grain weights @3000FPS &amp; 11:1, 12:1 for lighter weight bullet stabilzation. Any bullet can be fired in any twist BUT ACCURACY MAY FAIL!!&#xD;&#xA;The 300AACBlkOut is a 30 caliber bullett in a 5.56/223 case!

I did do some research on the Internet combined with some intuition. It's much more common to see folding stocks than pistol-grip only stocks and I reasoned that if a folding stock worked so would a pistol-grip only stock. As your question indicated, the problem is usually whether or not there is a buffer tube or spring tube in the OEM stock that would prevent you from putting something like a pistol-grip only stock on. To figure this out, you can search for &quot;folding stock Remington 11-87&quot;. Or, the owner's manuals often have an exploded parts diagram that will clearly show a spring tube if it exists and those owner's manuals are often available online from the manufacturer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples: &#xD;&#xA;For the Rem 11-87/1100. http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx had this image in the manual.

Some of those ranges will bend the rules for their regular customers. So once you get to know folks there or if you see others collecting brass, you might try asking again. At other ranges, you are expected to clean up after yourself (this is often called &quot;policing your brass&quot;) this includes taking brass home or putting it in their containers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming the range allows you to pick up brass, the other part of this is picking up brass from other shooters.  **It is rude to pick up someone else's brass without asking** or until it's clear it has been discarded (that shooter has left).

I'm going to try to leave my opinion out, and rather than tell you what brand / model to buy, tell you what to look for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The first, and very most important, feature of a handgun is you want one with a competent operator.  That's you.  Whether you spend $400 or $4000 on a pistol, you are not adequately prepared to use it in self defense until you've had a great deal of practice and / or training.  To paraphrase a quote by the (I think) Jeff Cooper: &quot;Having a handgun doesn't make you armed any more than having a piano prepares you to play a concerto&quot;.  Do not make light of this requirement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Fit your 'stopping power' theory.  Some people think bigger bullets are more effective, others believe higher velocity is more important.  Because of #1, being able to afford ammo is a serious concern.  I'd suggest avoiding expensive 'exotic' calibers and stick with the common (and relatively inexpensive) calibers: 9mm, .40, .45.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Find a pistol that fits your hand.  First make sure you're holding it correctly - a lot of people grasp a handgun so that it recoils against their thumb, rather than into their palm.  Make sure the barrel lines up with your forearm when you hold the pistol, and pick something that's comfortable to hold that way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. See that you can reach the controls.  Ideally you can hit the magazine release (on an auto) or the slide stop without moving your strong hand.  (This isn't always possible, just work as close to this ideal as you can).  You shouldn't have to strain to perform routine operations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Get a brand name.  Even with a name brand there's no guarantee, but if you find a no-name deal, it's likely to be problematic.  Glock, Kimber, Springfield, S&amp;W, Sig, etc. all make reliable firearms (and the occasional dud).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that's enough to get you started.  Some pistols you may want to look at:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ruger GP100 revolver,&#xD;&#xA;Kimber or Springfield 1911,&#xD;&#xA;Glock in small, medium, and large frame (see what fits *you*),&#xD;&#xA;S&amp;W M&amp;P,&#xD;&#xA;Springfield XD,&#xD;&#xA;Sig Sauer in caliber of your choice.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Having a sight mounted &quot;far off&quot; the bore axis is OK, though there are a few quirks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - it can be a bit slow or awkward to shoot, since you'll end up with little or even no support for your cheek.  (The &quot;Delta HBAR&quot; model from a long time ago, before the days of &quot;flattops&quot; being common, added a special cheek support to compensate for this; arguably it looks a bit goofy/klugey. &#xD;&#xA; - At close range (less than 100 yards, but in particular at distances less than 20 yards), you will notice the effects of the bullet starting off several inches away from your sightline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To expand on the last point a bit.  If your sightline is three inches above your boreline and you are zeroed at 100 yards, when you shoot at 50 yards you'll find the bullet to be about 1.5&quot; below your aiming point; when you shoot at 20 yards you'll find the bullet to be about two and a half inches below your aiming point.  The most &quot;interesting&quot; situation of all is when you set up a chronograph 3 yards in front of you and carefully set things up so that you don't shoot your chrono - if you forget that at extreme close range your bullet is actually 3&quot; lower than your line of sight, you might end up putting a bullet through your chrono even though your sight picture showed that you were going to clear it.&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, the bolt lugs of a rifle need to have lubricant that stays in place even in the face of high pressure sliding/wiping contact.  A pretty ordinary grease does a good job of this, whereas a high tech high performance oil might not stay there after several dozen (or hundreds) of cycles - it's not that the high tech gun oil is a poor lube, it's just that it doesn't fit that particular application well.

I'm extremely biased so take this review for what it's worth-it was my first gun-but I had little to no experience with handguns other than online research, and have since put over 1000 rounds through it and am very pleased. I believe it retails for $529 but any typical gun shop will sell it for less. I paid $420. Also in terms of ammo 9mm is not a bad route to take. A second option would be slightly above your listed price range, but a great choice if you want something with a little more stopping power. It's the [Ruger SR1911 .45][2] which I absolutely love. Heavier, longer barrel, smaller capacity and a little more complicated to strip and clean, but a beautiful weapon with superb accuracy. All in all Ruger has my loyalty.

Lead has been used for a long time because of how cheap it is, it is easy to work with, the density and softness of the metal. The attributes of lead have allowed for the development of expanding bullets (due to lead deforming at high velocities on impact) and heavy bullets for penetration. Heavy weight lead bullets allow for penetration despite the fact that the bullet is losing mass due to fragmentation while passing through an animal (generally lead bullets lose ~15-30% of their weight). Non-lead bullets on the other hand expand due to specific manufacturing and are designed to perform exactly the same every time and extremely unlikely to fragment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Non-lead bullets are made of copper or guilding metal, and are therefore less dense than lead. This does not mean a reduction in performance however. Non-lead bullets tend to hold 98-100% of their weight and expand to approximately 2x diameter. They put about the same foot/lbs of energy into a deer sized ballistic gelatin block at 100 yards. In all non-lead bullets tend to perform the way that bonded lead core bullets are manufactured to and actually do it better. The idea that non-lead rifle bullets will damage barrels is not accurate as they are made of metals that are used to jacket lead core bullets. Impacts on the barrels are for all intents and purposes identical. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several things to consider when switching to non-lead. The first is that because they are less dense bullets of the same weight will be slightly longer. Therefore, to maintain accuracy it is often a good idea to actually move to a lighter non-lead bullet as it will match the twist rate more like a heavier lead bullet. If shooting light skinned game lighter bullets with a polymer tip will help to drive expansion even more. Also, shifting a little bit farther into the shoulder as the point of aim will increase expansion.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having tested numerous types of lead and non-lead bullets in ballistic gelatin, water barrel tests and in hunting situations, I am convinced that non-lead bullets are a technology that far surpasses what is capable with lead. Lead worked for many years due to reasons I talked about earlier, but with expanding monolithic non-lead bullets they have created bullets that will out-perform the old standbys. Everything that is required for a hunting bullet is there. Deep penetration, great expansion, and high accuracy with the added bonus of not leaving fragments of lead behind in gut piles or worrying about finding it in the game meat you are eating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information on the testing we have done, available non-lead bullets, some pricing comparisons and lots of articles check out www.huntingwithnonlead.org." />

If you're someone that always buys the most expensive ammunition available, you're not going to see a big difference in price.

It's the other end where you see the big differences, as shown in this graph created from the same data:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![price comparison graph][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're someone who always buys the *cheapest* ammo you can find (which is a lot more like me--and, I suspect, most of us) the switch to unleaded ammo will cost you an extra 71% on average.

There's a red bar missing from the chart because between four major brands at two retailers there was no steel 45-70 ammo offered.

I actually won't use any lubricant/penetrating cleaner from the firing pin face, all the way to the rear of the gun, only rubbing alcohol. I also use separate brushes for oil and non-oil work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Field strip it like the manual shows you and clean the barrel like you would any other gun,&#xD;&#xA;stick with nylon brushes. I like to use Ballistol here, scrub the barrel once, 1-2 wet patches, and run dry patches (1-2) until clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Scrub the mag well and everything to the rear of the locking lug block using your alcohol only brush. I like to use shredded micro fiber rags and wrap my brush while I do this. While holding the slide with the firing pin facing down, scrub the firing pin face and the extractor claw,(You want it facing down so no grit falls back into the firing pin channel.&#xD;&#xA;) then lay flat and use same brush to clean rear of slide around trigger safety plunger etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the front of the slide, I use an &quot;oil only&quot; brush with rag lightly soaked in Ballistol to get at all the areas and then buff them down with a shop cloth or some other general purpose rag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to actually lubricating the slide. You need to make up your mind on what you want to use for lubricants. You can't buy that goo **[1]** glock distributes with their new guns so I take it all off with rubbing alcohol and then replace it with TW25. Then I just clean the frame rails with lightly soaked Ballistol (penetrating lubricant and cleaner) rags and reapply TW25 as needed to the slide rail channels. TW25 doesn't run either so you can easily apply it to the trigger bar like the manual says and it won't run down into your frame. A drop of that in the locking block area is good too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's really it, any other lubrication point is optional, some people like to put a little grease on the top side of the barrel. It's really up to you. &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;qtips are great for detail work, so are pipe cleaners albeit a little more expensive. The later bits are necessary though when you break down the rear of the slide and service the striker channel and other spring loaded channels. NO LUBRICANT THERE, the plastic and the metal finish is sufficient. Do that about once a year or 5000 rounds, whichever comes first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you still need a hand getting through the basic field stripping/re-assembly process. See hickok45's youtube videos on glock cleaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Update 3/29/2012**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I've learned since that this is copper anti-seize grease who's primary purpose is to ensure the slide can break free from the rest after the gun has been sitting in a warehouse for who knows how long. There may be a use case where the operator seldom fires their pistol to maintain the anti-seize grease in addition to regular lubrication. Having lots of firearms and not enough time to give them all a turn is also a good argument to maintain the anti-seize or some other grease layer on the slide." />

Ammunition capacity is pretty clear - all else being equal, more rounds are better. There is also weight - bigger grips and magazines with more rounds lead to a heavier loaded weight, which may be a concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grip size and shape is an issue as well. Grip size can affect concealability, but I think that a good fit to the shooter's hand is more important. It's possible for a person of any hand size to hold and fire a pistol of any grip size, but accuracy and recoil control are much better when the barrel axis is lined up with the arm bones of the shooter when the gun is held in a firing grip. This may not be possible if the grip is too large or small for the shooter's hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, I have relatively small hands, and I cannot get a really good grip like this on many double-stack pistols with mainsprings in the grip, such as the Beretta 92 series, especially when I also need to be able to reach the long, heavy double-action trigger. On the other hand, I know several shooters with large hands who prefer these larger-gripped pistols. Caliber is a factor too - double-stack 45-caliber pistols have even larger grips than double-stack 9mms." />

(Google 'cratex' and you can find smaller kits or individual pieces).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would highly recommend disassembly regardless of how you do it - you won't have to worry about touching the slide or frame or getting 'grit' in your pistol.  Removing the thumb safety is relatively simple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Take the slide / barrel assembly off the frame just as you would for cleaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Ease the hammer forward to relieve pressure from the mainspring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. With a punch, drive out the mainspring pin (the pin at the bottom rear of the butt).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Slide the mainspring housing down and out of the pistol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. If the 3-fingered spring falls out at this point, don't worry about it.  It will fall out by the time you've removed the safety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Put the hammer in the cocked position.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. Starting with the thumb safety in the 'fire' position, start pulling the safety out while raising it toward the 'safe' position.  A little bit before it gets all the way to normal 'safe'position it should start to pull out.  This might take a bit of fussing to find the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. As the safety comes out, it frees the plunger in the plunger tube.  It's unlikely to fly away, but watch it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;9.  Withdraw the safety completely.  If it's an ambidextrous safety the passenger side is removed by rotating it so its 'tail' clears the grip scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;10. At this point the grip safety will fall out (along with the 3-fingered spring if it hasn't already).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---Go do your work on the safety.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Re-assembly is just following the directions in reverse with the following exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Start by placing the 3-fingered spring in position.  The bottom should engage the slot in the bottom back of the frame. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Push the mainspring part way in place to hold the 3-finger spring in place for the rest of the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't forget the hammer position ('cocked' when inserting the thumb safety, 'fired' when re-installing the mainspring).  Use a 1/16&quot; punch to depress the thumb safety plunger while pushing the thumb safety home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/METAL-FINISHING-CRATEX-ASSORTMENT-PIECES/dp/B000HQICXE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334632727&amp;sr=8-7" />

I have been in urban combat situations and have _never_ had to shoot so suddenly that I did not have the time to put my finger on the trigger. I doubt that the act of putting the finger on the trigger is any slower than the time it takes me to form a judgement about whether or not to shoot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, any time I have pointed my weapon at someone my eyes were looking across (or just above) the sights, my finger is in the trigger guard, I've already put a round in the chamber, and I've already batted my head to the left and the right to determine where else there may be trouble. I have practiced going from just-holding-the-M16 to loaded-and-ready-to-make-holes in a very quick and aggressive-looking manner. The whole point is to make them think that you will shoot, so that you don't really have to. This works great for aggressors whose goal is my own harm, but it works less well for aggressors whose goal is a quick ticket to Paradise. But that is their decision to make, not mine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't ever forget _your own goal_ when handling a weapon: your own safety and the safety of those who you are charged with protecting. Hurting aggressors is the method, not the goal. Much more often than not, scaring them is just as effective a method as hurting them, and it is safer for yourself and for those around you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Last thing: know your weapon. Whenever you get a new firearm, &quot;fire&quot; it without any rounds to feel where the trigger release is. Be able to put 90% of firing pressure on the trigger without firing it. Your finger will thus learn the weapon, and you will be safer and in better control both with the finger on the trigger and off of it. Your rounds will find their target better, too, especially on the range and at night.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] White lie as now my thumb is broken and I have to open the safety with my left hand." />

To perform an aggression (such as an arrest).&#xD;&#xA; 3. To perform a defense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously the most critical of these reasons is the third, and in that scenario you will be lucky to have the time to properly place your ear protection on, much less eye protection.

Twenty twos are cheap, easy and fun to shoot.  All of the important basics can be acquired and honed with a .22 without having to contend with significant recoil (the less fun part) or a .45 inch sized hole in your foot (the much less fun part). Move next to the 9mm and last to the .45.  I love my .45 cal Kimber.  I love to fire my 9mm Glock after a few rounds with the .45.  After the .45, the Glock feels like a .22 and is so controllable and accurate.  The suggestion of buying a .22 conversion kit is a good one.  I have one for my 9mm and use it to practice trigger control, marksmanship and to keep my wife involved in shooting.  Find a range that rents guns and shoot as many types and calibers as it takes to make you comfortable enough to make your decision.  And...have fun!&#xD;&#xA;" />

You'll need a high-pressure oil system in order to run the gunn drill (deep hole drill).  Then a reamer (no biggie), then a rifling head.  If you wish to do cut rifling, some indexing features are needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While not really plans, there's enough information in [This Guy Lautard Video](http://lautard.com/rmv.htm) to construct a good machine.

The part that wears out is the crimp, so that's the part to watch.  Once the mouth of the case starts getting ragged you can probably eek another load out of it, but the crimp will no longer look store-perfect.  I generally keep my hulls in 'generations' and when a significant percentage begin to produce lousy crimps I toss them.  I get only slightly longer life from premium hulls (STS Premier, Win AA)." />

There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting with a .40 or .45.  I like starting shooters with a centerfire handgun round, because then they can develop form in dry fire (what a .22 would give you) but still acclimate to a 'real' pistol.  .22 is a lot of fun, but it is inadequate in preparing shooters for a centerfire handgun, and often people trained on the .22 have extra discomfort with the centerfire pistol because they've developed habits which work fine with a .22 but are poor for a real caliber.  Training does work in the opposite direction: people trained on centerfire pistols do fine with a .22." />

There are comp. usenet forums over 30 years old, they don't die due to lack of use. It's a &quot;channel&quot; issue in IMHO, many users in this field are accustomed to the forum board posting style. Even though you're clicking through pages and pages to read a thread, you can't reply using email, or even quote a poster without additional effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason this site failed is that it wasn't aggressively marketed to those established channels or advertised that it even existed. If you don't set out to create and sustain a community, it's success becomes the luck of the draw, and it appears that we're out of luck. Great, now firearms knowledge can fall back into obscurity where I need to find that &quot;guy&quot; who's a walking encyclopedia but can't be bothered to write any of it down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This doesn't have to be the end, we could re-group, start developing a marketing campaign (blog, twitter, facebook, etc) and revitalize the community. I just can't do the forum format, it's a waste of time, extra login/passwords (I have 23). Overall I'm pretty shocked at the news, I didn't even know that this was a problem." />
