As the bullet flies (on a shot with ~0 elevation change), 100% of gravity's effect on the bullet is going to be &quot;downward&quot; as the sights are concerned, i.e. 90 degrees away from the shooter. In a significantly downward or upward shot, a good portion of gravity's effect is going to be back toward (when shooting up) or away from (when shooting down) the shooter, as opposed to &quot;down&quot;.

A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small &quot;heat shield&quot; has gone missing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at the cylinder's &quot;star&quot; at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is &quot;full lockup&quot; - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check for &quot;rotational wiggle&quot;.  A little is OK on S&amp;amp;Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  &lt;strong&gt;UNLOAD&lt;/strong&gt; it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a &quot;circle behind a circle&quot;&#xA;effect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the &quot;loose rotational lockup&quot; guns (S&amp;amp;W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's&#xA;possible to &quot;nudge&quot; the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is&#xA;minimal, .003&quot; to .004&quot; optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006&quot; I'd be&#xA;unhappy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's&#xA;next &quot;click&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer&#xA;bar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light&#xA;sideways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger &quot;transfer bar pinch&quot; issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="34" LastEditorUserId="34" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-18T16:26:14.683" LastActivityDate="2011-11-18T16:26:14.683" CommentCount="6" />

For ammunition that you must rely on, if you have chambered a round once and have to remove it from the chamber, discard it or set it aside for training. If you are not depending on this ammunition to do your job or save your life (home defense, police, military, hunting, etc.) then you are fine with taking the chance of a misfire. For shooting at the range and just for fun there is no issue with rechambering rounds repeatedly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Repeated chamberings carries the risk of bullet setback, where the bullet is pushed farther back inside the casing. This can cause various problems and should definitely be avoided. If the bullet is lose or you can see a gap between the edge of the casing and the side of the bullet, toss it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the AR15 platform, the floating firing pin inside the bolt will repeatedly strike the primer of the round. 5.56mm ammunition uses hard primers so that the light strikes from the firing pin do not cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problems arises when the primer is lightly struck repeatedly. The primers will be more and more prone to failure with each strike, even after a very small number of chamberings. A large california SWAT department had two documented issues with this, one a misfire during a raid and one when they went to the range to fire the rest of their ammunition in an attempt to diagnose the problem. Others have had issues as well and I have seen similar things on ranges in the military.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, despite what appeared to be good primer strikes, two problems&#xA;  were discovered.

The failed round&#xA;  from the potential OIS incident had a primer strike of only .013&quot;—the&#xA;  minimum firing pin indent for ignition is .017&quot;. In addition, the&#xA;  primers on the other rounds were discovered to have been damaged from&#xA;  repeated chambering. When the same cartridge is repeatedly chambered&#xA;  in the AR15, the floating firing pin lightly taps the primer; with&#xA;  repeated taps, the primer compound gets crushed, resulting in&#xA;  inadequate ignition characteristics--despite what appears to be a&#xA;  normal firing pin impression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.m4carbine.net/showthread.php?t=19881&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5.56mm Duty Loads&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Gary Roberts (aka DocGKR)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-09T05:10:01.117" LastActivityDate="2011-11-09T05:10:01.117" CommentCount="0" />

The reason you hear of the help in accuracy is because if you&#xA;chamber barrel with a reamer that has a dull throater instead of cutting&#xA;clean sharp rifling it smears a burr up on the down wind side of the&#xA;rifling.  It takes from 1 to 2 hundred rounds to burn this bur out and&#xA;the rifle to settle down and shoot its best.  Any one who chambers rifle&#xA;barrels has tolerances on how dull to let the reamer get and factories&#xA;let them go longer than any competent smithe would.  Another tidbit to&#xA;consider, Take a 300Win Mag. that has a life expectancy of 1000 rounds. &#xA;Use 10% of it up with your break in procedure for ever 10 barrels the&#xA;barrel maker makes he has to make one more just to take care of the&#xA;break in. no wonder barrel makers like to see this.

From barrel maker Lilja Precision:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We recommend that your new Lilja rifle barrel be properly broken-in to&#xA;  obtain the best accuracy. A proper break-in will help ensure that your&#xA;  barrel will clean easily in the future and that you will achieve&#xA;  maximum accuracy potential. Please follow these important&#xA;  instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We are concerned with two types of fouling: copper fouling, which is&#xA;  caused by bullet jacket material being left in the barrel, and powder&#xA;  fouling. During the first few rounds a lot of copper fouling will be&#xA;  left in the barrel. It is important to remove this fouling completely,&#xA;  after each shot, to help prevent a build-up later on. Powder fouling&#xA;  is ongoing, but easy to remove. Do not use moly-coated bullets during&#xA;  the break-in procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And again from Krieger Barrels we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kriegerbarrels.com/Break_In__Cleaning-c1246-wp2558.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a third story&lt;/a&gt; regarding not the bore, but the throat (left as an exercise for the reader).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the answer to the question of barrel break-in?

Human beings are not meant to have a small explosion go off in their hand.  When we're forced to do so, we tend to want to get it over with as quickly as possible, hence the jerk.  Unfortunately, all that extra pull on the trigger throws off our point of aim (usually low and to the left for a right-handed shooter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way to avoid jerking the trigger is to use what is called the surprise break.  In the surprise break we press the trigger slowly to the rear so that we don't know the exact moment it's going to go off.  That way we don't have a chance to jerk or flinch until the shot has already left the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several techniques to combat trigger jerk and help you achieve a surprise break.  First, do lots of dry fire practice (working the gun's trigger without any ammunition in the gun).  Concentrate on pressing the trigger straight back, slowly increasing the pressure until it breaks and the gun goes off.  Second is the ball and dummy drill.  Get some dummy rounds in your caliber (also called snap caps) and load a magazine with a mixture of live ammunition and dummy rounds.  It's best if you get someone else to load the magazine, but if you're at the range by yourself you can load several magazines and randomly select one.  The idea is that you won't know whether the round in the chamber is a live one or a dummy.  If you jerk the trigger on a dummy round, it will be obvious because the barrel dips down when the striker falls.  Keep racticing these drills and you can beat that trigger jerking problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastEditorUserId="79" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-02T12:32:17.077" LastActivityDate="2011-11-02T12:32:17.077" CommentCount="3" />

They have ports that are placed and angled to use the forward energy and expansion of the gasses inside the barrel to push the rifle forward during recoil. In this way, they reduce perceived recoil in the shooters shoulder (or hands, for pistols). They can also be designed to mitigate not just rearward felt recoil but also muzzle rise. With an effective brake a shooter can feel less recoil, and recoil will have less effect on the movement of the muzzle. Instead of &quot;flipping&quot; up and right, for example, the recoil will press your weapon straight back, allowing you to maintain your sights on the target.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muzzle brakes are also the most common attachment point for suppressors. Many people with brakes usually run a &quot;can&quot; always-on with muzzle brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brakes are very popular in sporting events where very fast follow-up shots are important like 3-gun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muzzle brakes have the unfortunate disadvantage of increased noise and muzzle blast. Muzzle blast being the felt shock of the exiting gasses and pressure from the barrel. With a standard flash hider, they can be generally directly outward or forward of the shooter, while muzzle brakes direct them slightly rearward or very rearward. This will make shooting next to a gun with a muzzle brake very uncomfortable and &lt;strong&gt;very loud&lt;/strong&gt;, again the shorter the barrel the worse this problem becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Flash Hiders&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flash hiders are designed to reduce the bright light signature of still-burning powder exiting the barrel. The shorter the barrel, the more unburned powder remains as the round exits, the brighter the flash, and the less effective any flash hider is able to be. The longer the barrel, the more effective for the opposite reason. Flash hiders come in MANY designs, varying degrees of effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flash hiders are available as suppressor mounts, and are popular with people who want to take their &quot;cans&quot; on and off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Compensator&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are usually muzzle brakes designed to mitigate muzzle movement over felt recoil. In the military, compensator often also refers to the A2 style &quot;birdcage&quot; flash hider. This term can be used interchangeably, but is likely to be too vague in most contexts and should be avoided unless there's context (for example with military weapons, which almost universally run flash hiders so saying compensator in that context would be quickly understood).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compensator can also be a term used for a device that attempts to do both recoil- and flash-reduction. Devices like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://battlecomp.com&quot;&gt;Battle Comp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knightarmco.com/mod_weapons_4.htm&quot;&gt;Knight's Armament Triple Tap&lt;/a&gt; fall into this category. These devices are greatly outnumbered by the number of hiders and brakes on the market. While both of these devices listed are intended to reduce muzzle flip, adjust recoil, AND mitigate flash, Knight's refers to the Triple Tap as a flash hider, while Battle Comp uses the term compensator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-02T17:45:05.930" LastActivityDate="2011-11-02T17:45:05.930" />

You take it out day one and you can't even FIND where you're shooting. It certainly isn't the target. How many squirrels must die before you learn how to aim it at the proper place? That's ok, squirrels are tasty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zeroing a rifle is when you center the rifle's point of aim exactly on the either the crosshairs of the scope or your center of the point of aim on your sights. Basically, if you pull the trigger, does the bullet land exactly where your crosshairs were pointing? If not, your gun is NOT zeroed!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how do I zero my rifle?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you shoot your rifle at a target. You have NO idea where it landed. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First. Bore sight. When you shoot your rifle in an open field at a target you will see NOTHING unless you got it on the target. What if you never got it on the target? Not your fault, but guns are NOT accurate right out of the box. The bullet will land wherever the barrel or BORE is pointing, not counting trajectory. The problem is how do you know where your BORE is pointing? Your scope is supposed to tell you that. It first needs to be calibrated. That is what 'zero'ing your rifle really is. It's calibrating your scope to your rifle. Now, in our scenario we are shooting in an open field against a target that has the sky as a backdrop. You cannot see where your bullets are landing because they're not on target. Therefore, you have no way of knowing if your bullets are too high, low, left, or right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if you could look down the bore of your rifle &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; look through the scope at the same time. That would make it SUPER easy to see if they lined up. Too bad our eyes aren't on stalks. We have the next best thing. We can make the bore TELL us where it's pointing. This is the bore sight. This is accomplished by virtually any gun dealer in the country. It can also be done by you in your own home if you have a bore sight yourself. They're fairly cheap and can run as low as $20 at any place like Sportsman's Warehouse. A bore sight is inserted either into the chamber (if the bore sight is shaped like a round) or into the end of the muzzle. It's a laser. It does nothing but point straight ahead. Once that's in there, turn it on and then adjust your windage and elevation until that laser is pointing right on your crosshairs. Bore sight done!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your scope is NOT accurate and is NOT calibrated aka NOT zeroed! Why not? That laser was lined up PERFECTLY with the crosshairs! The problem is, the laser is CLOSE to where the bore is really pointing. Right now, chances are your bullets will land ON THE TARGET. That is what we want!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what now?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We zero it manually! First a lesson on what Minute of Angle (MOA) is. MOA is equal to 1 inch at 100 yards. So if you are shooting 1 inch left of the bullseye, you are 1 MOA left. Your most common scope has an adjustment level of 1/4 MOA. This means if you turn your windage 4 notches left, you have moved your point of impact 1 inch in that direction if you are shooting on a target 100 yards away. 500 yards away? 4 clicks is going to move you 5 inches. 1000 yards? 10 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you're aiming at your target. Bore sight was finished long ago. You pull your trigger. Individual rounds don't count. Only where your GROUPS are. With that in mind, make 2 more shots. How close are your rounds to EACH OTHER? If they are close, that means you're shooting accurately. Your RIFLE isn't, but you're doing the work properly. Find the CENTER of your shot group. You look through the scope after you recover from the recoil and you see your group 2.5 inches UP and 3 inches LEFT of your target. Most people say to work on windage first, then work on elevation (or vice versa) but not both at the same time. I agree with this just because it prevents you from mixing things up. Let's hit windage first. Your group is 3 inches to the left. You need to move it 3 inches to the right in order for it to be directly vertical to your bullseye. If 4 clicks means 1 inch at 100 yards, how are you going to move your shot group to the right? 12 clicks right should do it. Take another 3 shots and repeat until your groups are perfectly vertical of the bullseye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, you have to move the round DOWN until you're on target. If done properly, your round is now 2.5 inches above the bullseye and perfectly centered horizontally. Let's move your round onto the bullseye. 2.5 inches, 4 clicks per inch, you're looking at 4 x 2.5 = 10 clicks. Move your scope down 10 clicks. 3 more shots. Is your shot group on the bullseye? If not, repeat until it is. If it &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; on the bullseye, congratulations! You've just zeroed your rifle for the 100 year line! You can now say with confidence that with the current settings, your groups should always be spot on assuming YOU are doing YOUR job with the aiming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These settings are always your starting point when shooting at other distances as well. Let's take the 300 yard line as an example. If you point your rifle down range at a target 300 yards away and pull the trigger, since you haven't changed your zero (also called your dope), you should still be SPOT ON, right? No. When you throw a baseball, does it fly in a perfectly straight line? No, it drops more the further it flies. This is the trajectory. Bullets are definitely not immune to the laws of physics. (&quot;Obey physics... IT'S THE LAW!&quot;) You need to use your elevation to compensate for this bullet drop. Here is a table for 155gr .308.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RANGE   DROP&#xA;100     0&quot;&#xA;200     2.87&quot;&#xA;300     11.2&quot;&#xA;400     25.6&quot;&#xA;500     46.9&quot;&#xA;600     76.0&quot;&#xA;700    114.9&quot;&#xA;800    161.7&quot;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means if you are shooting at 300 yards, your bullet will hit 11.2 inches below the target. You have to move it 11.2 inches UP. We know that 4 clicks is 1 inch at 100 yards. If we're moving it 11.2 inches, that means 45 clicks up right? NO! At 300 yards, 4 clicks is THREE inches. You need to take it up about 15 clicks. If 1 click = 1/4 in at 100 yards, then it equals 3/4 inch at 300 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So your zero at 100 yards gives you a baseline. If you move to the 300 yard line, you have to move your round up 11.2 inches if using a 155gr .308. If you move to the 700 yard line, be prepared to move your round up 76.0 inches. Obviously different sized bullets, different amounts of powder, and different calibers will give you slightly different results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wind also has drastic effects on the bullet. The further out your target is, the longer the wind has to affect the path of your bullet, pushing it left or right. Wind coming STRAIGHT AT YOU or wind that is traveling WITH the bullet do not have a measurable effect on the path of the bullet. Only wind coming from the side in any measurable fashion.

What is important is the twist rate of the rifling, generally specified in number of inches for a full rotation. You can calculate a stability factor for a bullet given the bullet weight, caliber, length, muzzle velocity, and barrel twist rate, plus the temperature and pressure of the air where you are firing. All else being equal, longer bullets, lower twist rates, and lower atmospheric temperatures and altitudes make bullets less stable. Generally, once the stability is above the limit, the bullet will fly straight, and there is no benefit to adding more stability. If the stability is below the limit, then the bullet will tumble in flight and generally be wildly inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For common calibers firing factory loads, this is generally not an issue, as they are all pre-calculated to be stable in all ordinary conditions. The only somewhat common case I know of where this is a problem is for firing M855 or 62 grain bullets in AR15s with the early-model 1 in 12 inch twist barrels. Doing this will reportedly result in group sizes of 1-2 &lt;strong&gt;feet&lt;/strong&gt; at 100 yards.

Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber can only grow in length as they increase in weight.&lt;/strong&gt; When selecting a barrel many barrel makers will allow you to select your preferred number of lands and grooves. Sometimes for more money, sometimes as part of the regular price. At almost all levels of shooting this is not something that needs to be worried about, and more focus should be paid to the twist rate. To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bullet stability and twist rate&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through. A 1:7 (&quot;one-in-seven&quot;) twist is one full rotation for every 7 inches of barrel length. To calculate the amount of twist needed to stabilize a bullet you would use a formula known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling#Twist_rate_and_bullet_stability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greenhill Formula&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/8/4/d/84d1d28d700535884f8a2c2c2403b641.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Greenhill Formula&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;D = bullet's diameter in inches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;L = bullet's length in inches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SG = bullet's specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the length of the bullet is used, and not its weight. &lt;strong&gt;The longer the bullet becomes, the more spin it requires to stabilize. In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off. Conversely, if you fired a 77gr bullet through a 1:9 you would lack the stabilization that bullet requires, and your groups would be large and erratic. At relatively close ranges you would experience bullet tumbling and other erratic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bullet stability and the number of lands/grooves&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number of lands and grooves in a barrel is not impoartant, but the surface area ratio between the land width and groove width is. This ratio is what determines things like drag, blowby, and tendancy to foul. The fewer grooves you have, the easier it can be to clean fouling from the barrel. A smaller number of lands and grooves can also affect a barrel's lifespan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riflebarrels.com/faq_lilja_rifle_barrels.htm#3%20Groove%20and%206%20Groove&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;From barrel maker Lilja&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A few years ago we started to make barrels in a 3 groove configuration&#xA;  too at the request of some varmint hunters who were looking for longer&#xA;  barrel life. They were chambering barrels for hot 22 caliber varmint&#xA;  rounds and shooting the throats out of conventional 6 groove barrels&#xA;  fairly fast. We reasoned that if we reduced the number of grooves to 3&#xA;  but kept the ratio of land to groove width the same (ie. the lands are&#xA;  twice as wide in a 3 groove barrel as compared to a 6 groove) that&#xA;  there would be more land area to resist heat erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Well, it turned out that barrel life did increase and that accuracy&#xA;  stayed at least the equal of comparable 6 groove barrels. It is hard&#xA;  to put a percentage increase on barrel life but a conservative&#xA;  estimate might be 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And we found that as a side benefit the 3 groove barrels seemed to foul&#xA;  very little and clean up quickly. We attributed this to the reduced&#xA;  number of corners inside collecting powder and copper fouling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, other barrel makers have stated that, as long as the ratio of lands to grooves is relatively constant, there is no appreciable difference in accuracy among 3-,4-,5-,6- and 8-groove barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barrel maker Krieger has said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There isn't any advantage to the shooter. ... Barrel makers use&#xA;  different numbers of grooves for ease of manufacturing and ...&#xA;  marketing hype.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Higher groove count barrels have slightly slower bullet velocities and also may foul a bit more quickly due to the higher number of edges cutting the bullet jacket and trapping residue.  Conversely, lower groove count barrels have slightly higher velocities, and foul less easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to marketing another consideration a barrel maker uses is the difficulty of manufacture. Some say that even numbers are much easier, and some say that odd numbers are easier. Button rifling, hammer forging, on and on. &lt;strong&gt;Lands-and-grooves is one of those voodoo magic kinds of things that you're very unlikely to ever worry about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of this, there are other methods of imparting twist to a bullet. The most widely used is &quot;polygonal rifling,&quot; in which there are no traditional lands and grooves, but rather flat sides inside the barrel that twist along its length. The merits of this system can be left for another question as they're outside the scope of this one, but the differences here are again more related to velocity, fouling, etc. and not the stability of the bullet in flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-03T02:33:50.053" LastActivityDate="2011-11-03T02:33:50.053" />

A 1:9 barrel will have trouble with loads much heavier than the mid-60gr range, which puts many very effective defense, long range, and hunting loads outside their ability to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, bullet stability is determined by the rifling's twist rate. &lt;strong&gt;Twist rate is dependent upon the length of the bullet and not the weight, it just happens to be that bullets of heavier weights in a given caliber and material(s) can only grow in length as they increase in weight.&lt;/strong&gt; To know your desired twist rate, you will need to know the range of bullet weights you will be shooting. It is possible to both under- and over-stabilize a bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bullet stability and twist rate&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twist rate, as expressed in most modern weapons, is the length of barrel required to complete one full rotation of the bullet as it travels through.

In a given caliber, a bullet can only expand in length as its weight increases, but weight is not the deciding factor.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early AR-15 rifles, before being adopted officially by the military, had a 1:14 twist rate suitable for firing only very light bullets. As bullet weights (and lengths) increased this has reduced to the current rate of 1:7. Commercial rifles come in, commonly, 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9. When firing, for example, 55gr or 62gr bullets any of these rates will do. However, if you were to fire a 40gr varmint round through a 1:7 you would rip the copper jacketing off.

There exist bolt-action uppers for AR-15 lowers in calibers all the way up to .50 BMG. Other reasons include the recoil buffer being too light, the recoil buffer spring being too weak, and the lower being the wrong dimensions to accept any of the myriad uppers build to fire .308 from an AR-platform rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantages of an AR in .308 (heretofore called the AR-10 platform for simplicity, even though the AR-10 is a specific Armalite model) are semi-auto capability in a harder-hitting round. It also maintains the same manual of arms as the AR-15/M4/M16/et al. platform, so training on the larger system is much more quick to pick up. The two platforms share many dimensions (trigger groups, pistol grip dimensions, rail/upper receiver height for mounting iron sights...) so aftermarket parts from the AR-15 are readily used on the AR-10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages are weight, size, and cost. The rifles are larger physically, heavier because of their increased size, and both the rifles themselves and the ammunition are more expensive. Another difference to be aware of is the magazine well and upper/lower dimensions. Armalite and DPMS have differing opinions on how this platform should be built, and have established two different patterns of gun. Most of the hard-use-gun makers (LaRue, LWRCi, LMT, Knight's) have standardized around the pattern used by the Knight's SR-25/M110 platform, but I can not remember which of the two the AR-25 is more similar to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a side note, the difference between 7.62mm and .308 is the opposite of the difference between 5.56mm and .223 — .308 is the more powerful of the two, and can fire both while 7.62mm chambers should not fire .308 rounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AK-47 platform may be a 7.62mm round, but it's apples-to-oranges to compare it with the 7.62mm NATO or .308 rounds. A better comparison for the AK-47's round (7.62x39) would be the AK-74's round (5.54x39), and in the AR platforms the AR-15 rounds 5.56x45 (5.56mm NATO) and 6.8x43 (6.8 SPC).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The M110 is a rifle built for the military by a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knightarmco.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Knight's Armament&lt;/a&gt;.

However, contrary to what you might hear from the manufacturers of night sights and tactical flashlights, this is not a problem that can be solved by buying hardware.  The hardware can be useful (I've spent lots of money with Surefire and Trijicon), but it's a supplement to training, not a substitute.  I would start by looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suarezinternationalstore.com/lowlightgunfighting.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;good low-light training class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side of things, I agree with Xander that a good hand held light is the place to start.  Not only does it allow you to illuminate things without pulling your gun on them, it also can deter thugs and makes a handy impact weapon.  It's particularly nice because, not being a 'weapon' you can have it in your hand, ready to go under a much wider array of circumstances than you could a pistol or knife.  When I'm walking through a dark parking lot I've got my Surefire in my hand ready to go.

A light with multiple modes, or that clicks on and off is a recipe for disaster in a fight.  The last thing you want is your light getting stuck on, or being set to the wrong brightness setting.  In the midst of a fight or flight reaction I want a light where I can mash down on the tailcap to get light and let my thumb up to turn it off.

Make sure your family knows that if something is going bad — strange noises in the dark, etc. — that they should either stay put or come directly to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few schools of thought when using a weapon-light (or a flashlight and a weapon together). The one I've seen most often is based on treating the light like its own weapon. Just as you would shoot, move, and communicate in a combat situation you should consider your light as &quot;shooting,&quot; and each time you finish shooting you must move. Lights and gunshots both give away your position. Communication can be to your significant other, to your children, to anybody you are working with (perhaps a roommate or other family members who are with you).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your light is mounted to your weapon, remember that anything you want to illuminate is having a gun pointed at them. If you hear a noise from your daughter's room and point the light at the door to see her coming out, you're pointing a gun at your daughter. Remember this when employing your light. If you have a weapon light you can use the cone of the light rather than the center for inspecting noises in places your family might be (another reason it's important they either stay put or come &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; to you). Or you can use a light that isn't mounted to your weapon. Independent lights compromise your grip and control of the weapon but give you a greater level of safety and mobility when inspecting your home. There are trade-offs in all things. I prefer weapon mounted lights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Training is vital.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can assure you from experience as a US Marine that people will not and can not &quot;rise to the occasion&quot; like they do in TV and movies. You will default to your most solid level of training. You won't suddenly have this part of your brain kick on because your family is at risk, imbuing you with heightened levels of skill. You must train to be proficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer that if you pick up a gun, you do so because you are prepared to kill somebody. If you're not prepared to kill somebody, find something else. A bat, some mace, whatever. &lt;strong&gt;If you are going to shoot somebody, do not fire warning shots, do not shoot to wound, and do not second guess yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're uncomfortable with the idea of killing somebody that's good: It means you're not a psychopath. But be prepared to do it, and accept that by using a gun you may have to kill in order to protect you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, very bright lights can be deterrents. They have a blinding and disorienting effect on people when you go from pitch black to 200 lumens directly in your eyes. Conversely, some people don't react to this as badly as others, and while their night vision will be totally blasted, there's a very very bright light that acts as a great target indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's very important that you know your house. That you know corners that provide good lines of sight. That you know the dead space where somebody could hide if they see you coming (like behind a couch in the middle of your living room, for example), that you know the common points of entry and exit to your home that may not be a door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note about home defense: A common myth is that racking a round into your shotgun will cause criminals to flee in terror.

The military generally uses FMJ exclusively due to the Hague Convention of 1899's prohibition on expanding bullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft point: A bullet with an exposed lead tip designed to expand as it passes through the target.

Bullets with an open hole in the tip designed to expand as they pass through the target.  The expansion produces greater damage in the target, as well as making it less likely that the bullet will pass completely through the target and overpenetrate.  Seen in both pistol and rifle calibers.  Generally the best choice for self defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballistic tip: A bullet with a soft plastic tip.  Ballistic tips are often applied to hollowpoints to make them more aerodynamic.  However, not all ballistic tip bullets are designed to expand.  Some match target bullets, like the Hornady A-MAX line, have ballistic tips for aerodynamic reasons even though they are not designed for expansion.  Ballistic tips are also seen on some ammunition intended for use in tube fed lever action rifles, to avoid setting off the primer of the round in front of it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited to Add:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/revisions/316/6&quot;&gt;the elk hunting example&lt;/a&gt;, using an expanding bullet of some sort (hollowpoint or soft point) rather than FMJ, would provide additional terminal effect and be more likely to put the animal down quickly.  On game the size of an elk, you would want to use a bullet designed for controlled expansion (such as a Barnes TSX, Nosler Partition, or Hornady SST), not something like a varmint bullet designed for very rapid expansion (such as the Barnes Varmint Grenade or Hornady V-MAX).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the controlled expansion category, the main difference between a soft point, hollowpoint, and a ballistic tipped hollowpoint is going to be their performance at longer range.  Soft point bullets with lots of exposed lead are not particularly aerodynamic and are notoriously inconsistent at longer ranges because the exposed soft lead tip can be damaged or distorted during the loading process.  This doesn't really matter if you're hunting in thick brush and will be taking the shot at close range, but in more open areas where a several hundred yard shot is a possibility, a softpoint may not be the best choice.  Controlled expansion hollowpoints are generally more aerodynamic and accurate at longer ranges, and a ballistic tip can improve this even further (but remember that not all ballistic tipped bullets are designed for controlled expansion).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastEditorUserId="79" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-05T01:28:24.413" LastActivityDate="2011-11-05T01:28:24.413" CommentCount="3" />

Mid-length gas systems are advantageous for barrel lengths between 14.5&quot; and 18&quot; (inclusive).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 14.5&quot; barrel length benefits from a smoother recoil impulse and lower pressures thanks to the greater allowed expansion of the gasses in the barrel and decreased dwell time&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The 16&quot; barrel length benefits in the same way, as well as — in my opinion — looking much better as there is less naked barrel sticking out beyond the gas block. 18&quot; barrel lengths benefit from the opposite: an increased dwell time compared to the rifle-length gas system, and this helps improve reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other lengths of gas system include pistol-length and rifle-length.

The gas is fed into what's called the gas key on the bolt carrier (the thing on the top toward the front, an elevated tube with the opening toward the bolt) which allows the next steps in the cycle of operation (unlocking, extracting, ejecting, cocking) to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1: Dwell time&lt;/em&gt; is the amount of time the bullet stays in the barrel after it passes the gas port and begins sending gas back to operation the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-05T08:53:47.390" LastActivityDate="2011-11-05T08:53:47.390" CommentCount="2" />

Ignoring some variations in bullet velocity with barrel length, we can think about dwell time in terms of how long the barrel forward of the gas port is.  The other major variable here is how much pressure there is at the gas port to apply force to the bolt.  The closer you are to the chamber, the greater the pressure, the further you are, the lower the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eugene Stone designed the original M16 with a 20&quot; barrel and a gas port about 13&quot; from the chamber, giving 7&quot; of dwell time.  This is probably the best setup from a pure reliability standpoint, but it's a fairly long weapon, not the best for fighting inside buildings and the like.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the Vietnam war, Colt went through several less than satisfactory designs for shorter versions of the M16 before settling on the Colt Commando (also known as the XM177 or the GAU-5/A).  It had a 11.5&quot; barrel with a gas port 7.5&quot; from the chamber.  Note that compared to the rifle this setup has the gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but this is offset by a shorter dwell time (that pressure is acting for a shorter period of time).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Colt developed the M4 Carbine, they took the Commando and lengthened the barrel to 14.5 inches, while keeping the gas port 7.5 inches from the chamber.  This makes it possible to mount a bayonet on the carbine because the end of the barrel is the same distance from the gas block as it is on the rifle.  Comparing this to the M16, we have a gas port closer to the chamber (higher pressure) but it now has the same 7 inches of dwell time as the rifle.  This makes the M4 somewhat overgassed compared to the rifle, but it still works fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The military's widespread adoption of the M4 created civilian demand for a look-alike.  However, the National Firearms Act says that a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16&quot; is a Short Barreled Rifle, requiring a bunch of paperwork and paying a $200 tax.  Thus most manufacturers of M4geries added another 1.5 inches to the barrel to meet the 16&quot; minimum.  Now we've got a 16&quot; barrel with a 7.5 inch gas system.  The gas port is closer to the chamber than on an M16 (higher pressure) and the dwell time is &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt;.  This creates a substantially overgassed rifle.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This finally brings us to the midlength gas system.  Manufacturers recognized the issues with 16&quot; barrels and carbine length gas systems.  In response, they moved the gas port forward two inches (to 9.5&quot; from the chamber).  On a gun with a 16&quot; barrel, this produces a rifle with a gas port that's closer to the chamber than an M16 (but further than a carbine), and has a dwell time about on par with the rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The carbine length gas system on a 16&quot; barrel is essentially an accident of history.  Now, this isn't to say that a 16&quot; with a carbine length gas system won't run, but it will shoot a bit harder and suffer a bit more wear and tear than a similar gun with the midlength gas system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="79" LastActivityDate="2011-11-05T22:27:02.540" CommentCount="1" />

Contrary to what many people seem to think, an AR will run dirty, but it will not run dry.  Important lubrication points include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolt stem and gas rings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolt locking lugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bolt carrier, particularly where it runs on the rails inside the upper receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cam pin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charging handle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An AR does not need to be dripping wet to run, but excess lubrication will not hurt anything (the rifle will, however, blow excess lube out and onto your clothes the first time you shoot it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, reassemble the rifle.  It's basically the disassembly in reverse order.  One thing to watch out for is to make sure the bolt is oriented properly.

Every rifle should explain this process in its manual. Read your manual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two levels to which AR-pattern rifles can be cleaned. In the military, you will do what is affectionately known as &quot;Armory Clean&quot; or &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; every time you turn in a weapon. This level of clean can actually damage a rifle if done perpetually, but institutional inertia — &quot;that's the way we've always done it so that's the way we'll always do it&quot; — keeps this the norm. The other level of clean is functionally clean. This is much more common and will provide you with a reliable and smooth running rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The notion that ARs must be constantly clean to function properly is a myth. They must simply be well-lubricated and maintain a certain level of functional cleanliness. Lubrication is definitely the more important of the two. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eagtactical.com/&quot;&gt;EAG Tactical&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of training classes to many difference agencies and civilians, has a Bravo Company carbine known as &quot;Filthy 14&quot;. This is a loaner gun that people can use when they come to class should they need to borrow one. As an experiment, or maybe more likely as proof, Pat Rogers has kept this gun properly lubricated and VERY minimally cleaned for over 30,000 rounds and it runs very well (most malfunctions it experiences being user, ammo, or magazine related).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;AR Cleaning Wisdom&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important that you run cleaning rods through the barrel rod-first-patch-last, with the brush or eyelet at the far end following the entire rod through.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not because, as precision shooters like to say, you will ruin your barrel in some way if you don't run your rods the same direction as the bullet. It's just because the rods were designed to run that way. &lt;strong&gt;If you try to push them through patch-first, the patch turns back toward the rod and wraps it up, making it too big around to fit through the barrel.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; bend or break something, probably hurt yourself, and make this job extremely difficult. I've seen Marines, one holding an upper and one holding a rod with a patch stuck halfway down his barrel, pushing with all they're worth trying to get the rod out the wrong way. (Unsuccessfully.) Drop the empty end of the rod through from the chamber end, grab it when it comes out the muzzle, and pull the patch or bore brush through from the chamber toward the muzzle. It's seriously a one-man job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When cleaning the bolt, after you remove it from the bolt carrier you'll make your life a lot easier if you soak the whole thing in some sort of carbon-removing agent. As I answered in the question regarding cleaning solvents, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt; is amazing for this. 15 minutes soaking in this stuff and the bolt basically cleans itself with just a wipe down. This stuff is awesome. It's also reusable, so you can get 5 or 6 soaks of the bolt out of a single little bolt-sized container. This stuff is not required; you can get it clean with just regular cleaner and a lot of work, but seriously it saves so much time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will use q-tips to clean the rifle no matter how clean you want it. Functionally clean will require far fewer of them. Get the kind with a tightly wrapped swab on one end and a long sturdy stick handle. The tighter the swab on the end, the less likely it is to rip off and leave pieces in impossible-to-reach places. It's also smaller and will fit better in places like the firing pin channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You must understand that getting a rifle &quot;Inspection Clean&quot; will cover nearly every surface with cleaner. &quot;Functionally Clean&quot; will cover most of them with cleaner. When the pores of the metal are left to rest overnight they will &quot;bleed&quot; cleaner and filth and your rifle will be &quot;dirty&quot; again tomorrow. Marine Corps doctrine states that you will clean your rifles every day for three days after you return them to the armory, and this is why. When you pick up your rifle the next day, or the next week, and your hand gets covered in a gray slime of lube and cleaner, just wipe it down, lube the insides, and be assured everything is okay. You don't need to clean your rifle for three days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Inspecting Your Rifle's Serviceability&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before, during, and after cleaning is a great time to inspect your rifle for worn, damaged, or broken parts. It's also a great time to replace parts that need regular replacing like extractor springs, buffer springs, firing pin retaining pin, and gas rings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To check your gas rings, set the assembled and extended bolt and bolt carrier vertically on the bolt face. It should not fall closed under its own weight. If it does not fall closed, bump the table or whatever it's sitting on, and it should fall part way but not completely closed. If it does fall closed, you need new gas rings. &lt;strong&gt;You do not need all three gas rings for the gun to run. You do not need to make sure the gas ring gaps are not lined up. I've run thousands of rounds through an M4 on a range with 1 gas ring.&lt;/strong&gt; But if you're missing gas rings, there's no reason you shouldn't replace them with a fresh set if you have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things I inspect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do both hammer spring legs mirror each other?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the hammer lose or does it not swing in a straight path?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the hammer canted, or not parallel to the sides of the lower receiver? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the gas tube parallel with the charging handle channel in the upper receiver? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does the carrier slide forward easily, and without noticeable movement of the gas tube?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there only one lug on one side of the extractor?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the firing pin retaining pin looking like its had better days?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are my sights canted?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only use your barrel cleaning patches once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't re-use toilet paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Functionally Clean&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The level to which I clean my rifles on a regular basis. This level of clean will never pass an inspection but is perfectly fine to keep your rifle running. With this level and proper lubrication you will not have any problems that more cleaning could have fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove bolt from carrier, wipe down bolt carrier exterior and inside where the bolt rests&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Optional: at this pint I soak the entire bolt in &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disassemble bolt's parts: remove firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, firing pin, cam pin, and finally the extractor by pressing extractor retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; out with firing pin&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wipe down all of these parts.

Clean the firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, including the charging handle channel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point you can run a bore snake through your barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using your cleaning rods, run the bore brush (the bristly copper brush that screws into the rods) through a few times to loosen the filth inside the barrel. After three or four runs from the bore brush, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. &lt;strong&gt;Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch&lt;/strong&gt;. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along. If they are not, repeat this process with one wet patch and dry-until-clean until you see the walls of the barrel shine.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only use each patch once. Do not re-use patches for the same reason you don't re-use toilet paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the buffer spring and buffer from the buffer tube, wipe them down, and as much of the interior of the buffer as you can, then replace&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wipe down the interior of the lower receiver&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wipe down the exterior of the rifle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reassemble, lube, and function check. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Armory or Inspection Clean&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only time I clean my personal rifles to this level is for long-term storage, or after a few thousand rounds and a few functional cleanings have accumulated. I try to get a couple hundred rounds per month through my rifle, so this is probably every six months or so. Long-term storage for me is very rare. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Completely disassemble the rifle: separate upper form lower, remove bolt carrier and charging handle, remove stock if possible (collapsable stocks are very easy to remove&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the bolt from the carrier, along with firing pin, firing pin retaining pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and cam pin&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same optional bit applies here about &lt;a href=&quot;http://slip2000.com/carbonkiller.html&quot;&gt;Slip2000 Carbon Killer&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you scrape &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the carbon off the neck of the bolt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the extractor by pressing out the extractor retaining pin with the tip of the firing pin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clean the bolt face (where the locking lugs are and the firing pin protrudes) now that the extractor is out of the way. Clean the extractor. Clean the notch where the extractor spring rests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the buffer and buffer spring from the buffer tube.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clean the spring, clean the buffer, and try to shove as much of a rag as you can as far into the buffer tube as you can to clean that out too. Try to find something approximately buffer-tube-sized, wrap it in a rag, and shove it into the buffer tube. Eventually give up on cleaning the entire length of the buffer tube. Know that as soon as you put the spring and buffer back into the buffer tube, they will be slightly dirty again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove the handguards if you can.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove anything attached to any rails (possibly destroying your zero if you remove the optic and do not have a quality return-to-zero mount).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the cleaner of your choice, completely wipe down every exterior surface of your rifle. Wipe down the interior of the upper receiver, and as much of the lower as you can reach with your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using q-tips clean out every part of the rifle you can fir a q-tip into. Important ones include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The firing pin channel, about half of which will be easier to access from the side since you've removed the extractor&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The rest of the insides of the lower, around the lower parts kit (aka trigger group)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The gap between the pistol grip and the rear edge of the trigger guard (unless you've got a trigger guard that fills this gap such as the Magpul one)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The barrel extension (the part of the barrel behind the chamber, where the locking lugs of the bolt fit in — looks like a star to some people)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The tines of the flash hider, or the ports of your muzzle brake&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Under and around the gas tube inside the upper receiver&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The charging handle channel inside the upper receiver&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Around the ejection port cover, especially underneath its bottom edge where it rotates&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The front wall of the chamber of the barrel&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a bore snake, run it through a few times with some cleaner on it to get any big chunks of stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using your cleaning rods, run the bore brush through a few times, put the eyelet on, soak a patch with cleaner and run it through the barrel. &lt;strong&gt;Only run wet patches until you get a not-solid-black wet patch&lt;/strong&gt;. This probably means only 1 or 2. As soon as you see gray, or less-dirty areas of patch, switch to dry. Run dry patches until they come out clean. Run one more wet patch. Run a dry patch. It'll probably come out dirty. This is a battle you'll never win. Run dry patches again until they come out clean. Hold the barrel up to a light and look through it, you'll see if the walls of the barrel are clean or not. If they are, move along. If they are not, repeat this process with one wet patch and dry-until-clean until you see the walls of the barrel shine.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:&lt;/em&gt; collapsible stocks can be removed by simply pulling down on the pin that allows you to select the length setting. There is a channel on the bottom of the buffer tube with notches set deeper at specific lengths (usually 4 or 6 of them from start to end). Grab the lever that disengages this pin from the notches and pull it down farther than would be done if you used the lever. This will raise the pin higher than the rear wall of the channel and allow you to pull the stock completely off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT LOSE THIS PIN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3:&lt;/em&gt; Having the extractor removed will also help you to get the swab part of your cotton swabs out of the bolt when they rip off while you try to pull them out of the firing pin channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4:&lt;/em&gt; This is my system for running wet and dry patches.

For example, Michigan re-legalized the purchase of suppressors in September 2011 after having them disallowed back in 1977 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shekel.blogspot.com/2011/09/sound-of-silencers-can-now-return-to.html&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;). Regarding machine guns, &lt;strong&gt;a transferable machine gun is one that was manufactured and registered prior to the closing of the registry on May 19th, 1986&lt;/strong&gt;. Any machine gun manufactured after that date can only be owned by law enforcement, government, or FFLs paying the SOT. If machine guns of modern manufacture are what you're after, see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot; and evaluate the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the type of NFA firearm or suppresser you want is allowed in your state, the next step is to decide if you're going to &quot;manufacture&quot; — usually more accurately described as &quot;convert&quot; — your existing firearm (filling out a &quot;form 1&quot;), or simply transfer it as an existing NFA firearm or suppressor from the manufacturer to you (filling out a &quot;form 4&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two types of forms a person needs to know are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-1.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.1 (Form 1) — Application to make and Register a Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5320-4.pdf&quot;&gt;ATF F 5320.4 (Form 4) — Application For Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of Firearm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These forms can be found — along with instructions for their use — at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/forms/firearms/&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms Forms&lt;/a&gt; page and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-firearms.html&quot;&gt;ATF Online Firearms FAQ for the National Firearms Act&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;For transfer (to an individual, in my state):&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to buy a suppressor, or a rifle or shotgun that was registered as a short barrel version at the factory by the original manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Purchase the firearm or suppressor&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the firearm or suppressor arrives at your dealer, go to them and fill out ATF Form 4 — again in duplicate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your sheriff)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 4s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the package is returned to you with a copy of the approved forms and your attached stamp, take this paperwork into the dealer that's been holding your NFA firearm or suppressor for all these months. Most FFLs will charge you a rather large sum for transferring an NFA firearm or suppressor, which you will now pay and he'll hand over your merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;For manufacture of a firearm (as an individual, in my state):&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I already have, or will soon have, a rifle or shotgun that I would like to convert to a short barrel version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Purchase the firearm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go get, in duplicate, fingerprint cards from your local police and passport photos&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fill out ATF Form 1 — again in duplicate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Engrave your name, city and state on the firearm's serialized part — you must use a permanent section of the serialized part (the trigger guard or buttstock of an AR-15 are not allowed)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get the filled out paperwork signed by your &quot;CLEO&quot; or Chief Law Enforcement Officer (your Sheriff)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write a check or get a money order for $200 to the US Dept. of the Treasury&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put this whole package in the mail — all in duplicate: fingerprint cards, passport photos, signed and filled out ATF Form 1s — and wait for the ATF's NFA Branch to receive your package, cash your check, run your background investigation, create your tax stamp, and mail it back. &lt;strong&gt;Once you have the paperwork returned, you are allowed to assemble or modify your weapon.&lt;/strong&gt; You can purchase short-barreled uppers for AR-15s at any time, for example. Mounting that upper to a lower is illegal until the paperwork has been returned and your lower is engraved. Having a gunsmith modify the barrel length of your shotgun is illegal before the paperwork has been returned and the receiver is engraved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Variables&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Timelines for this fluctuate constantly. When I purchased two SBRs on a Form 4 back in 2006, the ATF took just over 2 months to return my paperwork to me. Current reported wait times as of early November 2011 are as high as 6 months. Some people report that a trust or corp makes their process go faster, others have experienced the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;there are a lot of variables in this process, state by state and for special situations&lt;/strong&gt;. State to state, laws allowing certain types of NFA weapons and suppressors can be different. Different people in the Sheriff's seat can choose to not sign off on your Form 4 or Form 1. They can also choose to simply not sign &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; NFA paperworkat all. This leads us to yet another variable: trusts and incorporation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A trust or a corporation (S corp, C corp, LLC, etc.) can own NFA firearms and suppressors. This can either be a true company such as a gun store (see the section below titled &quot;I Want To Be A Dealer&quot;), or it can be a corporation or trust acting on behalf of an individual (you, your estate) or group (your family). The biggest advantages (to me) in doing a trust or corporation are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reduction in paperwork&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trusts and corporations can not have fingerprints or passport photos, so these are not required&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trusts and corporations do not require a Sheriff's signature on the Form 1 or Form 4 (this is how you get around a grumpy, no-signature Sheriff)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility with the handling of NFA firearms after your death&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any trustee or member can possess and use the firearm or suppressor, rather than only the individual listed on the Form 1 or 4&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Removals of many liabilities from the individual&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many more intricacies and benefits to a corporation or trust. Trusts are preferred to corporations generally because corporations have ongoing fees associated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best advice I can give you about trusts is to talk to a lawyer who has set up NFA Trusts.&lt;/strong&gt; There can be differences between the setup of a trust for NFA items and a trust for normal assets. A lot of law firms and estate planning firms will have experience here, and again things can vary state-to-state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncestateplanningblog.com/2009/11/articles/estate-planning/trusts/nfa-gun-trusts-provide-many-advantages/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a good write-up about the advantages of using a trust for NFA items. Lawyers from some states may or may not be able to practice in your state, so this may only be good for reference. Maybe the author can practice in your state as well as his or you live in the same state, in which case he can help you. Again, you'll have to do your homework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;I Want To Become A Dealer&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be a dealer you must obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). An FFL alone will not let you purchase or manufacture NFA weapons.

Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've &lt;em&gt;shot the gun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith &amp;amp; Wesson's M&amp;amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp;amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-08T21:28:22.573" LastActivityDate="2011-11-08T21:28:22.573" CommentCount="6" />

One thing worth doing is to take the rifle out of the stock and ensure that the receiver and the interior are not oil soaked (e.g. from cleaning solvent).  If it is, wipe it clean and dry.  Assemble your action into your stock and tighten the screws to a uniform &quot;very snug&quot; level.

There are a few very popular choices here, the downright most popular in my experience being the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruger.com/products/markIII/index.html&quot;&gt;Ruger Mark III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruger.com/products/2245/index.html&quot;&gt;Ruger 22/45&lt;/a&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage to a .22 pistol is the lack of noise, muzzle blast, and recoil, and dirt-cheap ammo. This will give you the ability to practice without developing bad habits and to practice a lot for very little money. If you don't want to purchase one gun now and another gun later, you can purchase a pistol in a self defense caliber that has an available .22 LR conversion kit. This will allow you to practice your fundamentals of pistol marksmanship with the gun layout and controls you'll be using in a self defense situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Fundamentals&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;(And How You Can Relearn Them If You're Broken)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong foundation in the fundamentals of pistol marksmanship is the most important asset you can give yourself. The weight and caliber of the weapon will not have an appreciable affect accuracy if you have these fundamentals.&lt;/strong&gt; What weight and caliber will affect is felt recoil, which can have effects on your accuracy through things like anticipation of recoil, grip, and trigger use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know from personal experience how bad anticipation can be. When I first started shooting handguns, my cousin gave me a 1911 in .45 ACP. I didn't know anything about anything at the time, and for years I had to fight the natural urge to dip the barrel down in order to compensate for the muzzle flip post-firing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compensation of this kind will lead to heartache. You can not, and must not try to, compensate for the recoil of a handgun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tricks that I have used to get over this are three-fold. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shoot the heck out of a .22 LR handgun. Get a .22LR conversion for&#xA;your handgun of choice and shoot A LOT. The point of using the .22 is to&#xA;allow you to get used to the function of the gun without the worry&#xA;of recoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the&#xA;fundamentals is vital here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dry fire practice. Dry fire practice is essential for learning&#xA;trigger control. Make sure you dry fire with your centerfire&#xA;slide if you are using a conversion, not your rimfire slide.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rimfire guns should not be dry fired.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the fundamentals is vital&#xA;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When firing your gun in its normal caliber, pull the trigger&#xA;extremely slowly. Focus on your control of the weapon but do not focus on the trigger&#xA;break.

What am I doing wrong?&lt;/a&gt;. For a right handed shooter, &quot;too much finger&quot; can cause the gun to pull to the right and &quot;not enough finger&quot; can push the gun to the left. The answers on that question do an exceptional job of explaining the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Purchasing A Pistol&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally give these pieces of advice when purchasing a pistol (to be done in this order):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify the use for this pistol. Self- or home-defense? Hunting? Killing squirrels in your backyard? Range toy? (In your case, either learning with a .22 or learning and self defense with a standard handgun and .22 conversion.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you're buying from a quality manufacturer, and identify models from these manufacturers that you believe will suit your needs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you understand the total cost of ownership for your chosen models (how often does it require maintenance, how expensive is ammo, how good is support from the manufacturer, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIND A GUN STORE, FRIEND, OR PERSON AT THE RANGE WITH THIS GUN AND SHOOT IT. SHOOT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally ignore what people behind the counter of a gun store will tell you, and know the details of your chosen gun model(s) before you step foot in a store. (Less applicable to websites, as they don't have salespeople communicating with you directly.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After you purchase your pistol, if you will depend on this pistol to save a life &lt;a href=&quot;http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/129/how-many-rounds-should-i-fire-to-determine-whether-my-defensive-handgun-is-relia/142#142&quot;&gt;run 500-1,000 rounds of duty ammo under duty conditions&lt;/a&gt; through it to ensure reliability (preferably 1,000).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can not stress enough how important it is that you try-before-you-buy. Glocks may have an awesome reputation and be dirt cheap to purchase and maintain. They have a huge aftermarket and plenty of support from both gunsmiths and the manufacturer. I can't shoot most Glocks comfortably because of the grip angle. These are things you won't realize until you've &lt;em&gt;shot the gun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quality gun does not have to be expensive. Glock's pistols and Smith &amp;amp; Wesson's M&amp;amp;P pistols can be had for about half what you'll pay for a Heckler &amp;amp; Koch in the same caliber and barrel length. Does that mean that HK is gouging you? Well, not exactly. HKs are extremely good guns,  hard-tested and hard-used, with a hard-earned reputation for reliability and performance. And while you're going to pay an extra few bucks for the name you're getting a hell of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another good thing to do is go read message boards dedicated to your chosen brand(s) of pistol(s). Manufacturers can change things behind the scenes (like Glock's recent redesign for their 4th generation of pistols). Go where people already did the leg work. Find out what problems people are having with the gun you want. Say you find that a gun may not be 100% reliable, or that it has intermittent problems. If this is a range toy and the price is right, who cares? If this is a gun you intend to carry every day for self-defense, maybe you should keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total cost of ownership is a huge thing people overlook. Again the example of a self-defense weapon: you're going to want to train with the gun you carry. If you're shooting a .45, ammo is much more expensive than 9mm, which makes training much more expensive. It also makes your initial test for reliability much more expensive. If it's a range toy can skip the need to test for reliability altogether. 1911s require dutiful tracking of round counts. Extractor tension can require tuning, individual guns can be very picky about magazine/ammo combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without a doubt, the most important step here is to fire a gun before you buy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Training&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step you can take is to find a local training company with a good reputation. Ask around at the range when you see people who seem to know what they're doing. Ask a cop if you happen to run into one walking around the mall. Ask any of your friends or acquaintances that are gun enthusiasts. Generally with training, as with guns and ammo, you'll get what you pay for. There are also large companies that travel all around the United States offering training classes in different areas. If one of these may be in your area or close enough for you to drive to, you can take a class with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, taking the classes for a concealed carry permit (even if it's unlikely that you will be issued one) is a good place to get a basic grasp on the laws surrounding self defense and deadly force. I recommend caution here, as many instructors I've dealt with love to include opinion and preference right along with their presentation of the course. Looking up your local laws directly and speaking with other people at local training courses is great for this. A caveat to traveling trainers is they are unlikely to be as intimately familiar with your local laws (however many states share similar basics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="32" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-08T21:50:12.577" LastActivityDate="2011-11-08T21:50:12.577" CommentCount="4" />

There certainly are any number of&#xA;  examples of Commander and other compact 1911s that work or can be made&#xA;  to work just fine, and for CCW use they can be a viable option for&#xA;  some users. However, take a look at the history of unit issue service&#xA;  1911s - LAPD SWAT, USSOCOM, USMC Det-1, USMC MEUSOC, FBI HRT, FBI&#xA;  SWAT, and let's not forget over 95 years with all the branches of the&#xA;  U.S. military - and you won't find ANY major units that use anything&#xA;  other than the original full sized gun. Why? After you field 50 or 350&#xA;  guns at once and run thousands or even tens of thousands of rounds&#xA;  through them during training cycles, you'll figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;By virtue&#xA;  of their design, the shorter format 1911s reduce the window of&#xA;  functional opportunity for the magazine and slide to work together to&#xA;  feed, chamber, extract, and eject. This is an incontrovertible fact of&#xA;  life. Proper weapon setup, spring rates, and magazine maintenance are&#xA;  critical in running the shorter guns. Keeping after a few 1911s as a&#xA;  single hobbyist or aficionado is different than running a bunch of&#xA;  guns for a large unit. Remember that weapon down time equates to lost&#xA;  training and operational time. You want to minimize your maintenance&#xA;  issues, not increase them. Lastly, a full sized 1911 is very arguably&#xA;  a more efficient shooting and ballistic delivery platform than a&#xA;  smaller sized variant for the majority of users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One subject which we disagree on is that a Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW) gun is not a duty gun. However, his argument is that a CCW gun can be the center of your attention, that you can dedicate the time and effort required to get it running right and keep it that way. This is time and effort a unit-level armorer can not spend on individual guns when he has to take care of a huge number of them, and in your case your requirement is also that you don't want to spend a lot of time and money getting your gun in working condition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, CCW and duty guns both must be reliable out of the box and have a minimum of required modification and/or upkeep to be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastActivityDate="2011-11-08T22:31:15.613" />

With the slide locked back, use a bore-light (or a bright flashlight and a white 3x5 card) to look down the barrel. There should be almost mirror-like reflectiveness throughout the length of the barrel. Reject any firearm with any dark shadows (especially in the shape of a doughnut) encircling the bore as this is an indication of a bullet getting stuck in the barrel and being shot free, which leaves the firearm in an unsafe condition (meaning the next time the barrel receives excessive pressure it could fail).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When releasing the slide, it should fully close without sticking or any external assistance from you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check the safety mechanisms to ensure they are still functioning. Without going into every single safety system out there, what it comes down to is that the firing pin should not come forward (in a way which would strike a cartridge's primer) when any of the safeties are in place. This can be identified by the hammer falling or by hearing the striker release. If the owner allows you, stick a unsharpened pencil down the barrel, eraser first, to make testing the pistol easier. Some tests to try are: If the pistol has a magazine safety, remove the magazine and pull the trigger; For grip safety's, hold the pistol in a way which you can pull the trigger without depressing the safety; For de-cocking levers, depress it while all other safeties are disabled.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the pencil is sent sent forward during any of these tests, then the firing pin was released and the pistol may be unsafe (though I'm sure many users are okay without the magazine safety). Also note, if the pencil did not move forward enough to come out of the barrel then the firing pin is broken or it's spring is worn out. Failure of any safety should be considered immediate cause for rejection, because to get it fixed may not be cheap.

After you ensure that the rifle is unloaded and pointed in a safe direction:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check the serial numbers on the bolt handle, bolt, receiver, and/or barrel to make sure they match. A Mosin might not have all of these serial numbers on these parts, but any numbers it does have on these specific parts should match to ensure proper head-spacing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rotate the bolt handle up and pull it fully rearward, pull the trigger and remove the bolt. Check the barrel for a good shine and note that the reflected light is straight. By this I mean if you look directly down the barrel the reflected light should form an equilateral triangle. As you rotate the barrel, the sides of the the &quot;triangle&quot; should be straight, any curving indicates the barrel is bent  (the more pronounced the curve, the more severe the bend).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are buying a &quot;new&quot; Mosin, directly from a dealer, then it may have cosmoline in the barrel and possibly some soaked into the stock. So don't reject a rifle if the barrel looks a little dirty, but note that the cosmoline may be hiding rust or bulges. However, if buying a used Mosin, it should have been cleaned and no cosmoline should remain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the whole this next point is not a big issue, but to some it matters. Repair of the crown, or counter-boring, is done to a rifle that has received some sort of damage on the muzzle end of the rifle's barrel and is detectable by running your finger around for about an inch inside the muzzle and not feeling any rifling.

Glock's adoption as the Austrian Army's service pistol led to interest throughout western Europe and in the United States.

And I say this as a guy who has is always wanting more magnification in his rifle scopes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For spotting scopes, &lt;strong&gt;somewhere between 20X and 25X&lt;/strong&gt; is what is most commonly used for 1000 yards shooting.  I would suggest that you use something similar for 100 yard shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ability to resolve detail (be that bullet holes, mirage etc) is much more dependent on the &lt;strong&gt;clarity/sharpness of the the image&lt;/strong&gt; than the magnification used.  That is why seemingly-modest magnifications are used even for 1000 yard shooting; the difference between a $1000-$2000 25X scope and a $200 25X scope is not the magnification, it is mostly image sharpness (and to a certain extent waterproofedness).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many low end scopes are variable magnification, with top end magnifications of 60X or 80X.  In my experience the high end magnification of these scopes simply makes the field of view smaller and the image bigger and cloudier - it does not improve your ability to resolve small details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing particularly wrong with variable magnification and I wouldn't avoid buying a scope because it is a variable, but I also would not consider having variable magnification to be a feature worth paying for at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bird watchers and photographers are bigger users of spotting scopes than shooters.  Many features important to them such as colour trueness, fringing, low-light performance etc, aren't actually very important to shooters (in my opinion).  One can optimize a scope selection for shooting performance differently than birders or photographers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to magnification there are some other considerations.  &lt;strong&gt;Eye relief&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most important (this means how close your eyeball has to be to the eyepiece in order to see the image).  Most low-cost scopes require that your eye be so close as to be nearly touching the eyepiece.  Not only is this impossible to use if you wear glasses, even if you don't wear glasses it is very inconvenient.  You will find it much easier to use a scope that allows for an inch or even more of eye relied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some scopes are &quot;straight through&quot; (like a rifle scope), others have the eyepiece at a 45 degree angle.

Say a shooter is steady enough aiming and trigger control to break our shots within (say) a 3&quot; circle at 100 yards.  Obviously if he is aiming at a target at 20 yards he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 1/5th the size (since 20 yards is 5 times closer than 100 yards).  And if he is aiming at a target 300 yards away, he'll be breaking his shots inside a circle 3 times as large (because 300 yards is 3 times as far as 100 yards).  But in all cases, he is breaking his shots inside a 3 MOA circle, which is why it is much more convenient to describe the accuracy of a shooter in terms of MOA rather than in inches (because &quot;inches&quot; alone isn't enough, it always has to be paired with the distance too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as why MOA and why not other angular units (such as mils, or decimal degrees)?  A few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when measuring distances in yards and bullet locations in inches, an MOA is so close to being &quot;an inch per hundred yards&quot; that it is too convenient to ignore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some rifles are more accurate that one MOA and some are less, but one MOA is a pretty conveniently-sized measuring stick for rifle accuracy.  One MOA is pretty darn good for a factory rifle; 2-3 MOA is acceptable accuracy for most factory rifles; just about any half-shot-out rifle ought to be able to deliver 5 MOA; a half-MOA rifle is really quite something; a quarter-MOA rifle is a level that most competitive target rifles don't achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;also, one MOA is a usefully-sized measuring stick for shooter accuracy too (when firing prone with iron sights shooting jacket and sling, an intermediate-level shooter will put the vast majority of his shots into a 2-MOA circle; best-in-the-world level shooters can put ten out of ten shots into a 1-MOA circle but this is hard enough that they will savour it!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth the next most common angular measurement you will find is the &quot;mil&quot;, which is one part per thousand (the mil is bigger than the MOA, in rough terms a mil is about three MOA).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you're measuring your range in metres and your offsets in centimetres, one mil is ten centimetres at 100 metres.  Since a mil is pretty coarse most scopes with mil adjustments have clicks every 0.1 mils, so one 0.1-mil &quot;click&quot; is &quot;one centimetre at 100m&quot;.  Many European hunting scope have adjustment clicks labelled &quot;1cm at 100m&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="36" LastActivityDate="2011-11-09T12:41:48.253" />

Is this volume reloading, cranking out large numbers of low-cost rounds?  A progressive press may be your best bet.

Specialty reloading to produce a round not commercially available (making major with certain calibers in gun games, etc.)?  Choose a press deepening on how much of this ammo you plan to shoot.  Will you be reloading one caliber, or many?  Progressive presses often require more work to change calibers on.

It's function is to be pressed up by the floorplate of the empty magazine, locking the slide to the rear to indicate that your pistol has run dry, as well as making it easier to reload the pistol by simply sending the slide forward and not needing a complete stoke of the slide. Can it be used for releasing the slide? Yes it certainly can. Should it be? I've been told by many a 1911 gunsmith that it should not be used for releasing. Their reason is that it wears on the rear edge of the stop — the portion of the slide-stop that actually enters the notch in the slide — and if done frequently can lead to either early replacement of this part or failure of the slide-stop to lock back the slide reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real bottom line for this issue can come down to two things: how often you replace your parts, and what quality of parts you choose to purchase. A slide-stop made from machined bar stock will probably stand up to this just fine. A cheap MIM (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_injection_molding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;metal injection molding&lt;/a&gt;) part will not stand up to this nearly as well. As with all things, you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other arguments can be made for sending the slide home with a normal slide-racking stroke. First, it helps you maintain a better grip on the pistol. I know plenty of people who don't have long enough fingers to hit the slide-stop without breaking their grip. This forces them to reacquire a good firing grip before they can resume shooting. Second, it is a fine motor skill. &lt;strong&gt;Fine motor skills &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; accessible under stress. They simply require training.&lt;/strong&gt; People like to say that when you're flooded with adrenaline you won't be able to do small movements, or use fine motor skills, but this is certainly incorrect. Proper trigger control is a very fine motor skill. Even very poor trigger control is a fine motor skill. If you don't shoot the gun under stress &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to get these fine motor skills engrained into your mind, you will probably have very little luck doing them efficiently in any stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Sending the slide home on a round in the chamber&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forcing the extractor to jump the rim of the cartridge is bad for the extractor. There is almost never a reason to do this, and the extractor was not designed for it. You will cause unnecessary wear to the extractor and risk causing damage to it if done repeatedly. In the 1911 specifically, the extractor — I should say, the standard extractor as designed by John Moses Browning — is a tuned piece of spring steel. It has a reputation for being occasionally very picky about how you treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's really no reason to ever do this. Just put it in a magazine and load it normally. If you have to &quot;+1&quot; a carry gun or use up a single left-over round from the range, just rack a loaded magazine, eject and reload the top round, and reinsert.

Make sure the plunger tube is properly staked as is the ejector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make the gun more comfortable to shoot, I would start with good quality trigger and fire control bits.  Bar stock sear, disconnecter, hammer with a good trigger fitted to your hand and acceptable, reliable, safe trigger weight for the use of the gun. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To compliment the trigger, look at the controls – safety, slide stop, grip safety and sights.  Do you need a larger safety?  Single side or ambi?  Does your manual of arms use the slide stop as a slide release and can you use a higher profile stop?  High beaver tail grip safety with memory bump?  What kind of sights?  Higher and narrower with more light around the front sight?  Lo-mount sights?  Black/black or night sights?  Adjustable? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have made the gun more comfortable to shoot and a bit more personalized to the shooter, let's futz around on the accuracy department. Is the original barrel serviceable?  Would simply exchanging the barrel bushing and inspecting the points of lock-up improve the accuracy to a level we expect, or do we need to go the route of an oversized barrel, link and bushing set? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's cut up the frame...  Do you want an undercut trigger guard to help your hands get higher on the gun?  Checkering on the front strap and main spring housing – 20, 25 or 30lpi?  Checkering under the trigger guard, back of the slide and/or flat top the slide with serrations?  Finish it off with a set of grips...  G10, wood, rubber?  What level of aggressiveness on the grips?  Rough Gunners or smooth wood?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time for the finish.  What color do you want it and what do you want to protect it from?  Nicks and scratches or holster wear?  Humidity or sweaty hands?  Do you want it pretty in pink or coyote tan to match your khaki pants?  Black goes with everything, unless you want it blued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="166" LastActivityDate="2011-11-19T16:08:16.810" />

I don't agree with grease as a proper lubricant for firearms.  When grease is used in varied applications, it is in a “closed” system where the migration of the lubricant is limited to the confines of the closed system.  This closed system prevents the contamination from outside sources (dirt, dust, residue of combustion, etc) as these contaminants suspended inside the grease act as a very effective abrasive compound.  As an armorer, I have seen the effects of this abrasive effect on rifles, LMGs and handguns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with CLP or Break Free as “proper” lubricants.  Suspending teflon or the idea of being a 'cleaner' or 'protectant' in the same bottle as a lubricant does not make a proper lube.  Solvents are cleaners, protectants are varnishes and neither belong in the same bottle as a lubricant, no matter the label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not found anything as effective, cost-effective or ubiquitous as using synthetic motor oil as a firearm lubricant.  I can spill more than I use and still have plenty of lubed guns with a $7.00 quart of Mobil 1 from Target.  Most “gun lubes” are nothing more than a synth base with inert additives.  Even the ever-popular Miltec 25 is simply a synth gear oil for heavy equipment, packaged and sold (with a significant margin) for the shooting public.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important part of the lubrication process is where you lube, not what you lube with.  While the owner's manual is a good start, asking what lubricants actually do will give you an idea of where to place your lubricant.  “Where do I have metal on metal contact, where do I want to reduce friction, protect against wear due to the reciprocation of parts and where do I want to prevent galling?”  Answering those questions will give you the precise locations of where you should apply your liquid lubricants.  Putting KY Jelly on the corrects parts &gt; putting oil on the wrong parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, liquid lubricants do migrate and evaporate.  It is up to the user to ensure their firearm is properly maintained and serviceable.  That may mean reapplying lubricant at regular intervals even if the gun isn't fired/used.

The datum surface varies by caliber.  On most rimless / rebated rim straight-walled brass it is the case mouth.  On rimmed cartridges it is the forward edge of the rim.  On a belted cartridge, it is the forward edge of the belt, and on most other necked cartridges it is a point on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally you check headspace, rather than actually measure it.  (That is, you're looking for pass / fail rather than a number).  That said, headspace is checked with a set of two gauges - a 'go' gauge which proves that the chamber will accept a round, and a 'no-go' gauge which proves that the chamber will not chamber an out-of-spec round.  To test, you want to remove any spring-tension, such as might be caused by the ejector in an AR-15 bolt, or the cocking mechanism on an Enfield.  That done, you attempt to close the action on each of the gauges.  The action should close easily on the 'go' gauge, but not close on the 'no go' gauge.  The 'no-go' gauge is the one you normally are concerned with.  If the action closes on a no-go gauge the chamber is too deep.  At best this will result in overly deformed cases during firing, but it could also lead to a case rupture, which can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a rifle is found to have excessive headspace (closes on the 'no-go' gauge) it can be 'set back' on most rifles by a gunsmith as long as the chamber is relatively intact.

There are 7 stations arranged in a semi-circle starting under the high house and rotating around to in front of the low house, with an eighth station centered between the houses.  A shooter progresses from station to station.  At each station you may be required to fire at single birds and doubles (one thrown from each house).  The course finishes in between the houses firing one shot each at birds thrown one at a time from each of the two houses.  A perfect score is 24.  Because a box of shells is 25, it's typical to allow a 'mulligan' - a single opportunity to re-try a shot at the shooters discretion once per round.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trap is a game with a single house downrange of the shooter and five stations that the shooter rotates through.  The stations are close together, so it's a lot like shooting from the same spot.  Bird can fly out at any angle, but due to the position of the house are always some 'going away' shot.  People who shoot trap regularly get to the point where it becomes a competition to see who can stay awake the longest as round after round proceeds before anyone gets bored and misses. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sporting Clays is intended to simulate actual bird hunting.  Typical Sporting Clays is run as either 5-stand or 10-stand.  Each stand has a different shooting challenge and if you shoot at multiple clubs you will see tremendous variety.

Due to the variety, sporting clays is easily the most challenging and humbling of the three, but also the most time and resource intensive.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy shotgun shooting you should try all of them, as each offers something different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="254" LastActivityDate="2011-11-21T01:05:58.430" />

A concern then purchased the equipment from Brazil (and other manufacturers) and became what is now known as Taurus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the PT92 retains the original design of the Beretta 92 and Beretta deviated from the original design with the 92S and 92SB, the firearms were no longer substantially similar and Taurus could export the PT92.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The police agency that requested the relocated safety was the Polizia di Stato (Italian National Police) who preferred a decock/safety in lieu of the trigger and slide lock safety.

Usually, this autoforward is a result of a confluence of events and manipulations that relieve the spring tension of the slide against the slide stop, the stop lowers and slide moves forward.  Guns that have a relatively weak recoil spring due to wear or design, geometry of the slide stop and slide relief surface, position of the handgun, amount of force used to insert the magazine, and the cleanliness of the operating parts can have an impact to whether a handgun will autoforward or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to this confluence of events, I don't see using or expecting a handgun to autoforward as a viable technique during a slide lock reload.

I have seen many shooters who have grown used to this autoforward go into brain fade when it fails.

There are usually defeated by the act of pressing the trigger (Series 80 1911s and the vast majority of modern designs, Glock, HK, Sig, etc) or the grip safety (Schwartz style on Kimber Series II and S&amp;amp;W 1911s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disconnector.  Prevents the discharge of a shot when the gun is out of battery by “disconnecting” the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship until the slide is forward and in battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trigger Safety.  Most common on Glocks, a pivoting and spring loaded block that prevents rearward motion of the trigger unless a finger or other object covers the center face of the trigger, defeating the block.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manual Safety.  A manual switch that prevents rearward travel of the trigger (1911) or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.  Some manual safeties lock the slide as well (1911, Taurus PT92.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grip Safety.  Usually on the backstap of the gun, depressing the grip safety unblocks the trigger or ensures the proper trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Squeeze Cocker.  Exclusively on the HK P7, the squeeze action of the grip safety (cocker) on the front strap cocks the gun and allows it to be fired when the trigger is pressed in SA.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety Intercept Notch.  An oversized cut in the hammer of DA/SA or SA pistols to intercept the hammer in the case of sear failure.  Also known as &quot;half cock&quot; on 1911 style firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Loaded Chamber Indicator.  Visual and possible tactile indication that there is a round chambered.  Most modern handguns will have the extractor geometry (Glock, HK) to indicate whether there is a round chambered.  Other firearms may have a separate component doing as such (Springfield XD) while others have have a simple hole in the chamber for visual confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decocker.  Safely decocks and lowers the hammer from Single Action to Double Action without the need to press the trigger.  Can block the firing pin striker (Beretta 92 series with decock) and/or maintains the integrity of the firing pin safety function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magazine Disconnect.  Prevents the rearward motion of the trigger or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship when there is no magazine inserted into the gun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To list the Pros and Cons of each style would be an exercise in futility, as the relative value of each safety feature is going to be objective from shooter to shooter.  Most modern firearms are going to have a number of passive safety features that are mandated due to import guidelines or “gun safety” laws in varied jurisdictions.  It would be very difficult to find a modern handgun design that does not incorporate a firing pin safety, disconnector, safety intercept notch (on hammer fired DA/SA handguns).  On guns with light single action only trigger presses (1911, XD, P7), you will be hard-pressed finding a gun without an external safety and/or grip style safety.      &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="166" LastEditorUserId="166" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-11-23T16:11:20.833" LastActivityDate="2011-11-23T16:11:20.833" CommentCount="7" />

This isn't 100%, but it's followed for most gun designs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manual safeties are pretty much standard for single-action firearms (handguns and long guns), where the gun is meant to be carried with the hammer cocked and a short and light trigger would be all that prevents it from discharging. I'm not aware of any firearms like this that don't have a manual safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Double-action revolvers, where a long and heavy trigger pull cocks and then releases the hammer, almost never have safeties, as the long and heavy trigger pull is considered to be enough safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single-action revolvers also generally have no safeties, as they are meant to be carried with the hammer down on an empty chamber, so that you would have to manually cock the hammer to fire it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autoloaders with double-single actions (the hammer can be cocked manually or by the gun's action, giving a single-action pull, or it can be cocked and released by the trigger with a double-action pull) may or may not have a manual safety. They generally have a way to drop the hammer and return it to double-action mode safely (see Sig-Sauer decockers), and some have a manual safety that decocks the hammer and can be left on (such as most Beretta handguns). Double-action only autoloaders, where the trigger is always longer and heavier than a single-action, usually don't have manual safeties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autoloaders with double-action only or variations on that blur the line a little. True double-action only guns, where the trigger fully cocks and releases the hammer every time, and it can be pulled again without cycling the action, don't usually have safeties for the same reason as double-action revolvers. Newer striker-fired guns like the Glock, M&amp;amp;P, and XD aren't true double action guns as the striker must be cocked for each trigger pull, but the trigger pull is much longer and heaver than single-action guns, if not as much as a true double-action. Because of this, they usually omit the manual safety just like the double-actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Handgun trainers generally consider these striker-fired guns with no manual safety to be no less safe than any other handgun provided the same basic safety rules are followed.

It's a handful, but it is not unpleasant nor painful.  But I have a Marlin 336 in .32 Win Special (30-30 equivalent) and the cheekpiece tends to whack my face pretty viciously - it is one of only two rifles I've ever fired that actually hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting exercise to try if you have the opportunity to do this safely - take a .30-06 hunting rifle and from a standing position hold it at waist level horizontally (at &quot;from the hip level&quot;, but hold it like a pendulum and don't rest the butt against you).  When you fire the rifle you'll be amazed at how little recoil there actually is, it just sort of gently pops back a few inches.  But if that rifle is held in such a way that the scope or stock gets a good run at you, it can really hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="36" LastActivityDate="2011-12-01T13:07:11.220" />

If you need to shoot, you need to shoot quickly, you need to move quickly and know where the limit is for a given distance and target size.  In other words, if you train to be slow, you will be slow.  This isn't a license to be sloppy and demonstrate poor marksmanship, but rather having acceptable marksmanship in the shortest time possible.  If you are involved in a shooting, medical professionals will not be marking your hits on the threat for score.  Only hits count.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How fast is too fast and how slow is too slow? Through proper practice and training, you will find the tempo that is appropriate for the distance and size.  Think, “Goldilocks,” too fast, too slow, just right.  Work on a target at varied distances with varied tempos. Say, 3, 7 and 10 yds with three distinct shot tempos at each distance.  Shoot a pair with the intended result being two bullets, one hole.  Speed up the tempo to a reasonable cadence, maybe 1.5 sec split time between shots and the third tempo, put your foot on the gas and attempt to fire two rounds as fast as possible.  You will find the proper tempo for your skill level, distance and target size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the appropriate sight alignment and sight picture for a given target at X distance?  While the textbook “front sight post centered in the rear sight notch, flat and even across with a crisp front sight focus” may be appropriate for the head shot, trying to put a round between the running lights of your target at 10yds; that same sighting technique may not be appropriate if you are trying to put two rounds high in the chest at 5yds.  That larger target and the shorter distance will allow for more sight “slop” than the further, smaller target. How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same can be said about your trigger manipulation.  Same small target at 10yds, a smooth consistent press to the rear of the trigger, with a surprise break is textbook.  How much time are your burning if you applied the same manipulation technique as the target increases in size and is closer?  Are you minimizing the amount of distance your trigger finger and trigger have to travel by working the reset of your given firearm?  Are you burning time (and adding in margins of error) by having to reacquire the center face of the trigger and/or take up the slack for every follow-up shot?  How much slop can you get away with and get good effective hits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With those two points above, let me reiterate – don't sacrifice practical, combative accuracy for speed.  Only hits count and it is up to you to find that point that your sight speed and trigger speed is “good enough” for the size and distance of the target.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you taking advantage of your body mechanics to most effectively manage or recover from the recoil impulse as you are resetting the trigger and managing your sights?  Does your platform (stance) lower your center of gravity and push it just forward of your toes?  Does your platform allow your firearm return back to target after the recoil impulse to where it was just before the shot broke or are you “muscling” it back to target because you are not taking advantage of your natural point of aim?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is your dominant (trigger) hand high up on the backstrap of the gun and is your support hand getting as much contact on the gun as possible?  Crossed thumbs and/or support index finger on the front of the trigger guard will result in your hand losing contact with the gun, diminishing your ability to recover from recoil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the top shooters in the world and they have many things in common and one being highly defined and toned forearms and upper body.  Resulting in a very strong grip without fatigue and larger muscles absorbing the recoil forces. If you are trying to “stabilize” the gun with an ever-tightening grip and those muscle groups fatigue easily, your sight wobble will be worse despite trying to correct for it.  A self-fulfilling prophesy, if you will.  Get yourself a set of kettlebells and look for the “Shooter's Push-up.”  Isolates and works the muscles a shooter needs developed... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breathe.

The pattern depends on the individual gun, choke, and ammunition (which varies by shot size, weight, manufacturer, etc), and also on things like air temperature and wind.

Falling Block actions tend to be very sturdy, and are therefore unlikely to blow up in your face.

You'll have to throw that out occasionally, because higher pressures will accelerate throat erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to increase accuracy at range, you can fiddle with bullet design. Accuracy goes to hell when the bullet crosses the trans-sonic barrier, so decreasing the coefficient of drag and increasing weight (while keeping muzzle velocity constant) increase effective range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck and don't lose an eye!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12" LastActivityDate="2011-12-19T17:13:20.793" CommentCount="1" />

Mr. Castle founded Sabre Tactical and marketed Center Axis Relock to LE agencies.  While I don't fault Mr. Castle, much has been said about CAR being a rehash and repackaging of techniques used by other agencies well before he showed up...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that being said, there is validity to the technique in very narrow circumstances.  In my own experience, CAR-style shooting is applicable in very confined spaces (shooting from vehicles) and extremely narrow passageways that prevent a natural gait or platform.  While CAR allows for very quick recovery shot to shot, there is significantly more to a gunfight than a split time.  In my opinion, Mr. Castle took a technique for very narrow circumstances and attempted to apply it in more environments that don't call for the technique.  And yes, I have taken some CAR-influenced courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please allow me the liberty of dissecting CAR.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Platform – I don't agree with the extremely bladed platform.  It is not a natural fighting platform and significantly limits one's ability to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving – Maintaining the CAR platform, your ability to shoot on the move is severely limited.  Comparing distance covered, accuracy and shots fired, a natural toes, knees, hips, shoulders square to the target while shooting on the move was more advantageous than trying to maintain the CAR shooting platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple Targets – Transitioning from threat to threat is limited if you attempt to maintain the “body index.”  Faster and easier to drive the gun with a natural squared platform that many people can maintain &gt;180 degrees of engagement.  CAR has a very narrow cone of fire and footwork has to change substantially, especially when transitioning to a target to the flank opposite of the shooting hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving Targets – Tracking on moving targets is very limited for the same reason above.  Very easy to outflank a CAR shooter and force a footwork change within a very narrow angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bi-lateral Operation – The world is not made for R handed or L handed shooters and any proficient gun fighter should be able to operate their chosen weapon system ambidextrously.  Significant amount footwork to change the side of the body that you are working the gun from.  Added footwork = added time and delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency – CAR does a poor job of translating to other systems.  A natural squared platform can be used with a handgun, shotgun, rifle or submachine-gun without issue.  While CAR does “short stock” a long gun, it isn't ideal for anything other than bad breath distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsupported Shooting - Very applicable to the private citizen, as there is a strong chance that you will be shooting one-handed; fighting or grappling with your adversary, shielding/covering family members or holding your coffee...  No CAR instructor has given me a good reasonable answer on how to apply CAR unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, CAR does bring the gun closer to your eyes, assisting with shot to shot recovery and is a by-product of the bladed platform rather than a benefit.  But, no one has ever explained to me what a more “natural sight distance” is.  Because of CAR's bladed platform, the shooter is forced to sight with their support side eye, or the non-dominant eye for the majority of shooters.  Mounting in such a manner that CAR proscribes, the dominant (shooting) hand does a fine job of obscuring a significant amount of forward and peripheral vision from the shooting side eye.  I also question the utility and it being “natural.”  Humans have front set eyes (predator) that provide for very good visual acuity and depth perception compared to lesser animals (prey).  Under stress, humans square off to the perceived threat, bringing their eyes to the threat (taking full advantage of stereoscopic vision) and the rest of the body follows.  I have seen CAR-influenced/trained shooters absolutely resort to the natural position of being square to the threat in training evolutions where “targets” shoot back with non-lethal training ammunition (NLTA).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are reasons why contemporary firearms and tactics instructors DON'T teach CAR.  In my opinion, it doesn't work outside of some very narrow circumstances that CAR and Castle tried to escape out of and apply CAR to a wider battlespace and audience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a civilian, you do have the opportunity to receive high quality firearms and tactics training.

An 80% build is usually something that can be completed using a template or jig and in the case of the AR a tap for the buffer tube.  They can also be machined from scratch, or a raw forging by those with even modest machine tools.

The rules get a little fuzzier when it comes to sales - technically, you can sell a gun that you built, but if you are building guns for the purpose of selling them to others, then you need a Type 7 FFL (manufacturing license). The exact line is subject to interpretation by courts and federal agents, so it is generally best to stay as far on the good side as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/general.html#gca-manufacturing&quot;&gt;ATF's Website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Q: Does the GCA prohibit anyone from making a handgun, shotgun or rifle? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With certain exceptions a firearm may be made by a non-licensee&#xA;  provided it is not for sale and the maker is not prohibited from&#xA;  possessing firearms. However, a person is prohibited from assembling a&#xA;  non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from&#xA;  imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a&#xA;  tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun&#xA;  will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that&#xA;  the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and&#xA;  479.105]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the wrinkles is that a receiver that is less than 80% complete is not considered a firearm, and so can be built, bought, and sold just like any other chunk of metal. The exact definition of what constitutes 80% complete is similarly fuzzy, but there are multiple companies selling &amp;lt; 80% receivers intended to be finished at home (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ar15plus.com/default.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colfaxtactical.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Title 2 items (machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, destructive devices (guns with caliber &gt; .50 and anything involving explosives), and Any Other Weapons), things get more complex. They can all be made, but they must be registered first, before construction. This means that you can make you own suppressors, AOWs, short-barreled rifles, and shotguns under the same rules, but you must have a NFA &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/form1.html&quot;&gt;Form 1&lt;/a&gt; filed and approved with a tax stamp &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you start construction. It can be sold to another person only under normal NFA rules (the buyer must have an approved form 4 before they can take possession), and with the same provision that if it looks like you are manufacturing for the purpose of sales, then you need the appropriate manufacturing license.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making machine guns is a special case, because the BATFE will not register machine guns manufactured after 1986 for civilian possession. To register one, and therefore to legally manufacture one, you must be a FFL/SOT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Destructive devices are trickier - I don't personally know anyone manufacturing them, and haven't been able to find any solid information about it online. If you intend to manufacture anything involving explosives or large-caliber weapons, it would be best to ask the BATFE directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's the legal side. As for the technical side, it is possible to make almost anything at home, given the right tools and equipment. A quality CNC mill and a lathe will cover a lot of bases, and there are plans and forums online in support of fabricating parts for many popular firearms, including 1911 pistols and AR15 rifles.

But the simple answer to your question is that, &lt;strong&gt;ignoring ALL other factors (including human factors like you can't hit the broad side of a barn, or your target being high on meth and 350 lbs), a bigger and faster bullet will impart more energy to the target, and more energy is better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The longer the projectile becomes, the heavier it becomes. The larger the case, the more speed will be imparted to this heavier projectile. The more velocity behind a mass... Well, now we're in my high school physics class again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon entering a person a permanent wound cavity is created. The permanent wound cavity is tissue that is torn, punctured, and otherwise damaged in a way that won't heal itself. The more powerfull the bullet — or rather the more energy left in the bullet upon impact — the more severe the permanent wound cavity will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to a permanent wound cavity, there is a temporary wound cavity. Again dependent upon the amount of energy left in the bullet upon impact. The easiest way to visualize this is a mold of jello. Put your finger in and pull it out quickly. Now if you jammed your finger in there like Bruce Lee, the mold is probably moving around quite a bit. If you put your finger in really slowly, there will be less movement of the jello as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hole you made is the permanent wound cavity. It will be smaller than your finger because jello, like our bodies, stretches and is elastic. Again the more energy you used to puncture the jello the more permanent damage you will do. Maybe you ripped a few chunks off the surface for example. More permanent wound cavity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more energy imparted by the bullet, the more disruptive to your body the stretching and moving of organs associated with the temporary wound cavity will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ignores all manner of other factors such as jacket thickness and structural integrity for example. M855 ball ammo issued in the military has a ring where the cartridge neck is crimped to the bullet and sealed for waterproofing. As a side effect, that promotes jacket fragmentation, leaving the lead/steel core exposed to separate further. Longer bullets with more taper will yaw upon entry more severely as the heavier rear end maintains momentum longer than the light front end. Once the bullet begins to yaw, or rotate end over end, the permanent wound cavity expands. Again in M855 this yaw puts stresses on the ring which rips off the jacket which causes the lead/steel core to split into usually 3–5 pieces, creating a new network of permanent and temporary wound cavities. None of these examples apply to .22LR because its velocity is too low to rip the lead bullet apart, it has no jacket, and the yaw is much less severe due to bullet shape. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-12-30T15:51:20.397" LastActivityDate="2011-12-30T15:51:20.397" CommentCount="3" />

They heat up faster and dissipate heat slower, so you more quickly arrive at the point where your barrel should be given time to cool before it is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other, less-commonly-important answers include barrel harmonics, rigidity and accuracy. Heavier barrels are less affected by harmonics because there is more mass to them and more effort is required to distort them in any appreciable way. Rigidity also aids in consistency, which can increase the accuracy of the rifle (but not the accuracy of you — sorry, that takes practice). To visualize barrel harmonics, check out videos on YouTube of very-high-speed cameras filming the firing of a gun. The longer the barrel, the more &quot;shake&quot; there will be to it as the bullet leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, heavy barrels can have weight (and rigidity, given the same overall diameter) removed while increasing surface area (for greater cooling) with the aid of flutes.

You need to make up your mind on what you want to use for lubricants. You can't buy that goo &lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt; glock distributes with their new guns so I take it all off with rubbing alcohol and then replace it with TW25. Then I just clean the frame rails with lightly soaked Ballistol (penetrating lubricant and cleaner) rags and reapply TW25 as needed to the slide rail channels. TW25 doesn't run either so you can easily apply it to the trigger bar like the manual says and it won't run down into your frame. A drop of that in the locking block area is good too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's really it, any other lubrication point is optional, some people like to put a little grease on the top side of the barrel. It's really up to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;qtips are great for detail work, so are pipe cleaners albeit a little more expensive. The later bits are necessary though when you break down the rear of the slide and service the striker channel and other spring loaded channels. NO LUBRICANT THERE, the plastic and the metal finish is sufficient. Do that about once a year or 5000 rounds, whichever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you still need a hand getting through the basic field stripping/re-assembly process.

There may be a use case where the operator seldom fires their pistol to maintain the anti-seize grease in addition to regular lubrication. Having lots of firearms and not enough time to give them all a turn is also a good argument to maintain the anti-seize or some other grease layer on the slide.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="380" LastEditorUserId="380" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-03-29T15:34:17.483" LastActivityDate="2012-03-29T15:34:17.483" />

The cheapest brands (Remington bulk boxes come to mind) will unfailingly have about 1% duds.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magazines are probably the second biggest issue.  Being a rimmed cartridge it's harder to make a quality magazine for a .22.  Ruger has done quite well, and some of the 1911 conversions (TacSol and Marvel) have also made very reliable magazines.  Many aftermarket magazines do not perform well.  If you're using multiple magazines, number them and take note of the mag in use whenever there's a malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dirt.  The .22 is a dirty round.  A bit less so when you use the quality stuff, but it's still much messier than any centerfire ammunition.  .22's often run best pretty dry, to prevent accumulation of debris.  When the Akins Accelerator was still being sold (a full-auto mechanism) the manufacturer recommended a teflon-based dry lube (Liquid Wrench, etc. - available in home stores).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the firearm in question.  If you don't have 500 rounds through it, don't do anything (other than cleaning and light lube) until you reach that mark.  After that you might take a piece of crocus cloth and polish up any of the areas where you see wear.

Just coat the inside of the barrel with the CLP, wait a few seconds, then run the snake through it a few times. If you've got really tough fouling, use some heavier solvent and a brass bore brush then follow up with the clp and snake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't like to use CLP on any other part of the 1911. I prefer to just use a penetrating oil that can build up over time. This means a bit more elbow grease trying to get the grime off, but that's acceptable. I'll talk about lubrication in a second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wipe down the outside of the barrel with a cloth that won't leave lint. I actually really like those microfiber cloths that you use to clean monitors (see if you can pick some up in a bargain bin at an electronics store).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the slide, pay close attention to the rails and the space under the hook of the extractor. Scrub the rails with a soft gun brush - not a brass one - and use a cotton swab to pull out the loosened carbon. Be sure to inspect closely for any loose strands of cotton. Use the brush to make sure there is no carbon built up under the extractor. Any other buildup should be clear to the naked eye and easy to clean out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the frame, focus again on the other set of rails and use the same method described above. Don't forget the feed ramp! Anything else, again, should be pretty plain to see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be sure not to ignore the recoil spring. Inspect it and wipe off any gunk you find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For lubricant, I like to use MILITEC-1. It will build up in the metal over time and makes the action of the 1911 smooth as glass whether you run it wet or dry. Set the slide straight up on a flat surface, apply a drop of MILITEC to the back of each rail and let it drip down. Apply a moderate amount of oil to the barrel and work it over the whole surface with your fingers. Don't let any of this oil find its way into the bore! You shouldn't leave an excess of oil on the surface of the barrel, but I like to keep it a little wet. Use a small amount of oil on the spring and work it over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Series 80 1911s, there's a small &quot;nub&quot; on the frame just forward of the hammer that's a part of the firing pin block. Push down on it and slowly let the spring push it back up. If its movement feels grainy or sticky, put a small drop of oil on it and work it up and down until it moves smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the slide stop was difficult to extract, apply a tiny amount of oil to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's everything off the top of my head. You usually won't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to detail strip a 1911, but it can't hurt to do it a few times throughout the life of the gun.

In many cases the US seller is an FFL dealer.  yedit from RayJ:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;apply to Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT) for an International Import Certificate (IIC) by calling (613) 996-2387 or by faxing your request to (613) 996-9933 and requesting blank application forms. Once completed, the form should be returned to ITCan for processing and certification. Expect this process to take 2-3 weeks. The certified document will then be returned to the applicant for onward delivery to the US exporter. There is no charge for the IIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pre-register the firearm through the Canada Firearms Centre. Pre-registration allows the importer to clear the firearm through the Canada Border Service Agency without any undue delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the US exporter will attach their copy of the IIC to their application for an export licence. In the US, applications for shotguns are administered by the Department of Commerce and for all other firearms are administered by the Department of State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;once the US export licence is issued the US exporter may then send the firearm to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Canadian importer is responsible for declaring the value of the firearm to Canada Customs and for ensuring that all safe storage and safe transportation regulations are observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;within 30 days of arrival in Canada, the importer must have the firearm verified and such verification confirmed with the Canada Firearms Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a company that does exporting of firearms to canada:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopcontent.asp?type=importsteps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopcontent.asp?type=importsteps&lt;/a&gt;  Steps are at the link.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find a US Vendor who is selling the firearm you want to buy... can be either a business or a private individual or a US auction site like GunBroker.com... arrange a tentative purchase... and tell your US Vendor that you will be using Questar International as your &quot;US FFL Transfer Dealer&quot;.

It usually takes 6 to 10 weeks for them to review and approve the application...  (about 8 to 12 weeks for the overall process);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once all required permits are approved and received we then arrange to transport the firearm(s) to Canada and clear the shipment through Canada Customs (you will be responsible for payment of any duty and/or taxes levied by Canada Customs on your imports).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We will then verify and register your firearm(s) into the CFC database.&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firearm Marking Requirements legislation has been postponed until December 1st 2009&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We'll send you a Disbursements Invoice for any duty, taxes and final shipping costs applicable on your imported firearm... when payment has been received, we will arrange for the firearm to be transferred to your name.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We will then arrange final shipment of the firearm to you.  Please be aware that Canada Post now requires that ALL FIREARMS be shipped via Expedited Parcel, adult signature required, no safe drop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT:  It is impossible for us to give customers step by step updates on the &quot;progress&quot; of their import.

It's like kids in the car asking &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;... only in our car there are over 100 kids asking us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to track the arrival of your purchase to our US office then ask your Vendor to insure that the shipment has tracking details (or delivery confirmation) and that he sends you copies of the tracking info on the shipment, that way you'll know that it did arrive at our office and when. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the export paperwork is approved we'll schedule transport across the border and we will contact you when your gun arrives in Canada and is being entered into the CFC database... at that time you'll be sent your Disbursements Invoice and final arrangements for transfer and shipment will be made.

In terms of handgun ammunition, the most common measure I've seen to distinguish the relative efficacy of one cartridge versus another is knock-down power, which is a product of the muzzle energy, external, and terminal ballistics.  Given that 357 SIG and 357 Mag use the same diameter bullets (indeed, they can use the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; bullets), for the sake of argument we can ignore the questions of external and terminal ballistics and focus just on muzzle energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muzzle energy is a computation taking into account the weight of the bullet and the speed at which it's travelling when it leaves the muzzle.  I went to CheaperThanDirt.com and looked up the muzzle energy values for the top six most popular loads in each caliber. The average muzzle energy for the two cartridges: 357 SIG is &lt;strong&gt;501.23 ft-lbs&lt;/strong&gt;, 357 Mag loads is &lt;strong&gt;469.56 ft-lbs&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a reflection of what are the most popular items sold at CheaperThanDirt.com right now (and customer preferences can certainly change).

What kind is it?  Where did you order it from (links would be good)?  Typically, when you build an AR, you look at an upper receiver and lower receiver.  You will need a lower parts kit (sometimes called an LPK).  It contains the small components that fit into the trigger assembly and lower receiver (Safety, etc), and you will &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; need it.  Here is one from a reputable seller online:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/palmetto-state-armory-gen-2-moe-lpk.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/palmetto-state-armory-gen-2-moe-lpk.html&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wQ0OU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LPK from Palmetto State Armory retailer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That covers most of the Lower Receiver.  I'm glossing over a lot here, but the basics hold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The Upper Receiver:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with the Bolt Carrier Group and upper receiver portions of your AR.  AR's come in two variants:  Piston-driven and Direct Impingement (sometimes called &quot;DI&quot;).  Essentially, the two differ in how to handle the hot gas that your gun uses when it discharges a cartridge.  Without complicating things further in this thread, here is a quick and short video showing how the two operate: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7GTZ0DixqA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7GTZ0DixqA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sort of information (knowing your Lower, Upper, LPK and DI or Piston) are sort of the basics you'll need to know at some point.  The most common AR build is chambered in 5.56/.223 Rem.  I've seen some that are 7.62/.308 Win as well.  Your's is likely .223 or 5.56.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before you even consider firing a round in the rifle, &lt;strong&gt;make sure you know the gun inside and out&lt;/strong&gt; (you'll have to know most of it, since you'll be assembling it).  Not all uppers can fire 5.56 NATO cartridges when they are stamped .223 Remington.  This is due to the pressure differences the rifle will undergo on a 5.56 NATO cartridge vs the .223 Remington round.  However, if your rifle is stamped for 5.56 you can shoot any .223 and not have to worry.  I could go off on a tangent about the Throat leade in a .223 vs 5.56 rifle, but I'll refer you to this article first: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2677734/posts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2677734/posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, stick with whatever ammunition your upper tells you to use.  Read the manual :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I learned most of what I know by browsing the forums of a well respected gun-community called CalGuns (http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/index.php).  There are tons of &quot;how tos&quot; posted there, as well as deep information on ARs, components, parts, etc.  I'll plug them here since they've been a positive force in the gun ownership community, and taught me basically everything I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't recommend building an AR from scratch if this is your first gun.  Don't get me wrong, they're great rifles and work well when properly maintained, but to have never owned a gun and jump into it by building an AR might be a bit overwhelming, and you do not want to make mistakes.  If you can, friend a local gun shop (buy your ammo from them or any accessories, the AR is the barbie doll of the gun world, with a million and one useless accessories ;-)).  Friend the gun shop, then go in and discuss your AR, questions you have, etc.  If it's a good shop, they'll help you out because they realize you'll be in later to buy items for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps, and congratulations on becoming a gun owner!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="382" LastActivityDate="2012-02-04T05:36:58.457" CommentCount="2" />

The vision in your dominant eye will be at its most acute.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When one eye is closed there is strain in the muscles that focus the eye and the open eye dilates to collect more light.

A good example of ammunition that is “most likely to fail” is Winchester White Box (WWB). This rare failure is too low a percentage to make an issue, however it is one we are well aware of. The fix to resolve this issue is quite simple:&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clean and lube your slide and barrel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shoot 1 mag to 1 box of good quality +P or +P+ ammunition through the barrel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try the FTF ammunition again. If it runs... great!  If you experience more failures you will have a couple choices to make:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the recoil spring weight to 11 lbs. Cost is about $25 for stainless steel guide rod and reduced power spring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shoot 124 gr or a better quality 115 gr ammunition exclusively. The FTF 115 gr ammunition you are currently using is no longer a valid option.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;What causes this problem? Several issues come into play:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 40 slide and (40 conversion) barrel are thicker than standard 9mm slides and barrels. This extra thickness equates to more weight. The combined extra weight taps the energy of the &quot;weak 115 gr ammunition” to its complete demise. It simply lacks in power and fails to reliably eject the spent round.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every once in awhile a Failure To Feed/Failure To Eject (FTF/FTE) is caused by a fit issue. We resolve fit issues by pumping +P or +P+ ammunition through the gun. This hot ammunition provides extra pressure and the pressure will positively align any and all components. Once they are all aligned there is no longer a fit issue. The FTF/FTE is usually resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;FYI: Several manufactures are currently producing low powered 115 gr 9mm loads. This ammunition is also known to produce failures in all standard model Glock 9mm pistols.&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastActivityDate="2012-02-19T18:42:58.327" />

The downside to higher magnification is that you can see less in the scope, so you can concentrate really hard on that big, well-magnified 'X' and put a perfect shot onto your neighbor's target, because you couldn't see the target number.  Similarly you can get a field of fur and not know what part of an animal the crosshairs are on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarity.  You just have to look through the scope and see how clear the image is.

If you plan to shoot close to long range (both) target style adjustment knobs as well as fine (`1/4MOA) adjustments are nice.  For 100-300 yards 1/2MOA is fine.

Adjust your scope 3 MOA up and shoot a final 3-shot group.  A perfect scope (and competent shooter) should have a six-shot group and a perfect square made by the other 3-shot groups.

It is quite straightforward to shoot a .223 out to 600 yards/metres and get results good enough to enjoy the shooting.  And with the right preparation and planning (mostly in the choice of barrel twist rate, and the bullet used), one can shoot a .223 out to 1000 yards, in competition, and get results good enough to win regional or national rife matches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of my shooting is done on rifle ranges so this answer will be based on the kind of shooting that I do most (firing prone, with the rifle supported either by a rest/bipod or by a shooting jacket and sling, at 300 500 600 900 and 1000 yards).  I have done a bit of standing shooting too but I find that my rifle moves around much more that way ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For target shooting, with a well-supported rifle, more magnification always seems to be welcome (I've used 20X and 24X scopes and I've always wanted more; some of the top shooters these days are using 42X scopes).  I find that magnification needed/desired does not change with range - if the style of shooting (well-rested prone shooting, in my case) finds that 30X is useful at 600 yards, it'll also find 30X to be just as useful at 100yards (e.g. testing ammo) or at 1000 yards.  If you want to shoot standing, or other sorts of &quot;field&quot; shooting, you will benefit from having a lower power scope or a variable power scope.  As Gene mentioned there is a direct field-of-view vs. magnification tradeoff to be made.  I have shot at 800 yards with a 4X scope and things look so small you can't figure how it is that you are able to hit the target every time (but you can!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For target shooting, most shooters seem to choose very fine reticles, to allow them greater precision in aiming.  A very fine dot, or very fine crosshair, are some of the more common choices.  Myself I prefer very heavy reticles, even when using very high magnification scopes for high precision target shooting (I find that a thick reticle is always easily visible, and even if the reticle is substantially larger than the size of the area you wish to place your bullets in, you can nevertheless aim to a much finer degree than the size of your reticle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of the rifles you are considering are good choices.  Of the two I would choose the Tikka, they are one of the best out of the box factory rifles.  Not that you asked me but there are also some very good rifles made by Savage too (especially if you are looking for a factory rifle capable of competitively shooting 1000y).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case you don't know this, most provinces have Provincial Rifle Associations which enjoy free access to DND (military) ranges and offer very nice outdoor shooting programs from May to September every year, with shooting from 300y to 600y (and in some places to 1000y).

That's you.  Whether you spend $400 or $4000 on a pistol, you are not adequately prepared to use it in self defense until you've had a great deal of practice and / or training.  To paraphrase a quote by the (I think) Jeff Cooper: &quot;Having a handgun doesn't make you armed any more than having a piano prepares you to play a concerto&quot;.  Do not make light of this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit your 'stopping power' theory.  Some people think bigger bullets are more effective, others believe higher velocity is more important.  Because of #1, being able to afford ammo is a serious concern.  I'd suggest avoiding expensive 'exotic' calibers and stick with the common (and relatively inexpensive) calibers: 9mm, .40, .45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a pistol that fits your hand.  First make sure you're holding it correctly - a lot of people grasp a handgun so that it recoils against their thumb, rather than into their palm.  Make sure the barrel lines up with your forearm when you hold the pistol, and pick something that's comfortable to hold that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See that you can reach the controls.  Ideally you can hit the magazine release (on an auto) or the slide stop without moving your strong hand.  (This isn't always possible, just work as close to this ideal as you can).  You shouldn't have to strain to perform routine operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a brand name.

Lead has been used for a long time because of how cheap it is, it is easy to work with, the density and softness of the metal. The attributes of lead have allowed for the development of expanding bullets (due to lead deforming at high velocities on impact) and heavy bullets for penetration. Heavy weight lead bullets allow for penetration despite the fact that the bullet is losing mass due to fragmentation while passing through an animal (generally lead bullets lose ~15-30% of their weight). Non-lead bullets on the other hand expand due to specific manufacturing and are designed to perform exactly the same every time and extremely unlikely to fragment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-lead bullets are made of copper or guilding metal, and are therefore less dense than lead. This does not mean a reduction in performance however. Non-lead bullets tend to hold 98-100% of their weight and expand to approximately 2x diameter. They put about the same foot/lbs of energy into a deer sized ballistic gelatin block at 100 yards. In all non-lead bullets tend to perform the way that bonded lead core bullets are manufactured to and actually do it better. The idea that non-lead rifle bullets will damage barrels is not accurate as they are made of metals that are used to jacket lead core bullets. Impacts on the barrels are for all intents and purposes identical. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several things to consider when switching to non-lead. The first is that because they are less dense bullets of the same weight will be slightly longer. Therefore, to maintain accuracy it is often a good idea to actually move to a lighter non-lead bullet as it will match the twist rate more like a heavier lead bullet. If shooting light skinned game lighter bullets with a polymer tip will help to drive expansion even more. Also, shifting a little bit farther into the shoulder as the point of aim will increase expansion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having tested numerous types of lead and non-lead bullets in ballistic gelatin, water barrel tests and in hunting situations, I am convinced that non-lead bullets are a technology that far surpasses what is capable with lead. Lead worked for many years due to reasons I talked about earlier, but with expanding monolithic non-lead bullets they have created bullets that will out-perform the old standbys. Everything that is required for a hunting bullet is there. Deep penetration, great expansion, and high accuracy with the added bonus of not leaving fragments of lead behind in gut piles or worrying about finding it in the game meat you are eating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the testing we have done, available non-lead bullets, some pricing comparisons and lots of articles check out www.huntingwithnonlead.org.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="498" LastActivityDate="2012-03-27T17:25:51.587" CommentCount="2" />

The bottom should engage the slot in the bottom back of the frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push the mainspring part way in place to hold the 3-finger spring in place for the rest of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget the hammer position ('cocked' when inserting the thumb safety, 'fired' when re-installing the mainspring).

They're not small, but they can be surprisingly easy to make.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine is basically a special-purpose lathe with a long chuck (in order to hold the stock concentrically over its length).  You'll need a high-pressure oil system in order to run the gunn drill (deep hole drill).  Then a reamer (no biggie), then a rifling head.  If you wish to do cut rifling, some indexing features are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While not really plans, there's enough information in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lautard.com/rmv.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This Guy Lautard Video&lt;/a&gt; to construct a good machine.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="254" LastActivityDate="2012-04-27T02:37:34.117" />

There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting with a .40 or .45.  I like starting shooters with a centerfire handgun round, because then they can develop form in dry fire (what a .22 would give you) but still acclimate to a 'real' pistol.  .22 is a lot of fun, but it is inadequate in preparing shooters for a centerfire handgun, and often people trained on the .22 have extra discomfort with the centerfire pistol because they've developed habits which work fine with a .22 but are poor for a real caliber.  Training does work in the opposite direction: people trained on centerfire pistols do fine with a .22.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="254" LastActivityDate="2012-04-27T02:43:28.680" />

If you don't set out to create and sustain a community, it's success becomes the luck of the draw, and it appears that we're out of luck. Great, now firearms knowledge can fall back into obscurity where I need to find that &quot;guy&quot; who's a walking encyclopedia but can't be bothered to write any of it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't have to be the end, we could re-group, start developing a marketing campaign (blog, twitter, facebook, etc) and revitalize the community.
