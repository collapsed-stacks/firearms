<p>A vent rib barrel has a narrow, flat rib running down the length of the barrel, to which the sights are attached. Usually a bead sight. These barrels are designed to help disperse the mirage effect that can come from a hot barrel, hence the vent name.</p>

<p>It is also designed to give the eye a "runway" for use when quickly bringing the shotgun up to point at a target (clay, bird, etc.), giving the eye something to stand out against the plain surface of the barrel and lead it naturally down to the sight.</p>

<p>In the image below from Remington's online store, you can see the rib running along the top of the barrel with the bead sight at its tip.</p>
