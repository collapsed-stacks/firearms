What is expected of customers when they come into a shop to purchase a new firearm?  Most people working the counter have the patience of a saint, but what makes them cringe inside?  What are the dos and don'ts?  For example, is it alright to aim it at the wall, dry fire, field strip, ask to shoot a few rounds if there is a range attached, etc.?  Should you hand it back to them or set it on the counter?  Leave the slide/action open or closed?  Ease the slide back or let it go?

Above all else if you aren't sure about something, ask! In general, be gentle with their merchandise. You don't need to use kid gloves, but don't let the slide slam back into battery, do NOT use a wrist flick to close the cylinder on a revolver, and don't let magazines just drop to the ground unless you've asked or been told it is ok. Finally, be polite. 

Here are a few specifics to get you started:

 - When handed a gun, verify it is unloaded, then close the action gently while asking the counter guy for a safe direction for you to point the gun. Keep to that safe direction. Do NOT sweep the counter guy or anyone else.
 - Ask about dry firing before doing it. Some places really hate this. 
 - Ask about field stripping. I think this would be be weird for a new firearm, but probably not for a used one.
 - If you can hand it back in a way that makes it easy to verify it's unloaded (cylinder swung out or slide locked back), do so. Follow their lead as far as putting back on the counter. If he holds out a hand, hand it to him.
 - You probably won't be able to shoot a new gun, I've also never run into a shop that'll let you shoot a used gun, however some shops will let you quickly rent and shoot an identical model, then apply the rental price towards a purchase if you make one.
 - Don't argue. Don't go looking to prove you're smarter, better, more tacticool. If you ask their opinion, accept it. If they offer an opinion you didn't ask for, nod and smile. Even if you're convinced they are wrong, you don't need to correct them, just don't give them your business. If they are doing anything or encouraging anything you consider dangerous, leave.
 - If you see another customer doing something dangerous (like sweeping the muzzle around the entire store) tell your counter person. You can say something to the other customer directly or not, that's up to you. If the employees look at you like you're being silly, leave.
 - Don't surprise them. If you are currently carrying, don't suddenly present your own firearm. Yes, I saw someone start to do this once.
