What is expected of customers when they come into a shop to purchase a new firearm?  Most people working the counter have the patience of a saint, but what makes them cringe inside?  What are the dos and don'ts?  For example, is it alright to aim it at the wall, dry fire, field strip, ask to shoot a few rounds if there is a range attached, etc.?  Should you hand it back to them or set it on the counter?  Leave the slide/action open or closed?  Ease the slide back or let it go?
