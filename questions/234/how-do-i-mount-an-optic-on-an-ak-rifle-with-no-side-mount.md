I have an AK variant rifle without the side optic mount that some of the variants have. I would like to mount an optical reflex sight on it. What is the best option for doing this?

<p>There are several options.  For a reflex sight I prefer the <a href="http://ultimak.com/M1-b.htm" rel="nofollow">Ultimak rail</a> that replaces the gas tube.  This gets the sight forward and gives a better field of view around it.  If you prefer the sight in a more rearward position, Texas Weapon Systems makes a <a href="http://texasweaponsystems.com/id1.html" rel="nofollow">dog leg scope rail</a> that replaces the dust cover and rear sight.</p>
