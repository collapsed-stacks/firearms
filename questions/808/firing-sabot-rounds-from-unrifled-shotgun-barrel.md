Would firing a sabot slug through an unrifled shotgun barrel be unsafe, or just ineffective? What would actually happen?

The purpose of the sabot is to contact the rifling so the slug will spin, giving it a much more stable flight.  It isn't unsafe to fire them through a smoothbore, but they are much more expensive and your accuracy will suffer because there's nothing to create spin.  

[This guy](http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot46.htm) demonstrated with some good pictures.  You can see the groupings are much larger, and some of the slugs hit the target sideways, rendering hollow points useless.  It's not so bad that you won't still get the job done, but why pay more for ammunition that performs worse in your gun?
