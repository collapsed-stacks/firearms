How much does the 1/2 inch and inch difference between a 2, 2 1/2, and a 3 inch barrel effect accuracy in a revolver? How much does caliber effect it?

Mechanical accuracy is going to be very similar between 2" and 3" revolvers. The biggest differences are going to be in muzzle velocity and sight radius. A shorter barrel is going to give you a slower muzzle velocity, which means your bullet is going to drop more before it reaches the target (also, when it hits the sound barrier, it will deflect in weird ways). The shorter sight radius is going to make it more difficult to repeatedly line your sights up on a distant target. 

Basically, a 2" revolver, properly fired, can hit a 10 inch target at 25 yards all day (in a vice, you'll probably even get good groups). It'll be marginally more easy with a 3" revolver.

The inherent accuracy and precision of the gun will not be greatly affected. Your effective accuracy and precision will be, due to the sight radius.
