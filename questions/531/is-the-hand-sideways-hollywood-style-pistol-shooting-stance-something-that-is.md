## Is the hand-sideways "Hollywood" style pistol shooting stance something that is/was taught as a valid technique?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but [**shooting a pistol in a hand-sideways stance**][1] (so that the knuckles of the shooting hand are parallel with the ground) looks like a poor way to achieve accuracy; I've only seen this in Hollywood films, which makes it even more dubious-looking...but is this or was this a valid form of shooting stance? Does anyone actually use it for practical purposes, or is this some kind of criminal/gang-land sort of shooting technique? Why would anyone want to shoot this way?

Holding the pistol horizontally (the 'full homie' as it is sometimes called) is generally a lousy technique.  You don't have to hold a pistol perfectly vertically to achieve accuracy, when I shoot one-handed I usually lean the pistol inboard a bit.  However, once you exceed about 40 degrees of cant your ability to absorb recoil really suffers.

Some instructors will teach you to cant a pistol *slightly* when shooting one handed/weak handed.

There is also a similar method when employing the center axis relock technique:

I don't know the history of it, but I tried it once just because.  Amusingly, being right handed and left eye dominant, it did allow me to easily use my left eye for aiming since my hand blocked my right eye from seeing the target.  Slow, aimed fire was quite accurate.  Lining up the 3 dot sights vertically seemed very natural as well. Recovery for a second shot was much harder, since it felt like recoil was taking the gun sideways and gravity was taking it down, rather than gravity helping recover after the shot.  And it just looks dumb.
