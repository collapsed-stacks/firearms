I'd like to purchase my first firearm in the near future.  As I have no experience with guns, I'd like to take a training course.  What qualities should I look for in selecting such a course?  Alternatively, what should I avoid?  And is there anything I should keep in mind that is specific to the type of firearm (e.g., a shotgun)?
