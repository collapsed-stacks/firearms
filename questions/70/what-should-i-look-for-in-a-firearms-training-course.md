I'd like to purchase my first firearm in the near future.  As I have no experience with guns, I'd like to take a training course.  What qualities should I look for in selecting such a course?  Alternatively, what should I avoid?  And is there anything I should keep in mind that is specific to the type of firearm (e.g., a shotgun)?

I think the most important thing is to find instructors you are comfortable with and who operate their class safely.

Next, consider your intended purpose for the firearm you may purchase. If you want to learn about defensive shooting, make sure the course has a section on that. If you are trying to become a great long-distance marksman, that will be a totally different course.

I would initially avoid any classes that focus too much on "tactical" issues. Get the basics first. Safe handling and storage, legal issues in your locale and basic shooting proficiency. Any class that does not include a range component should be avoided, because it is simply not practical.

If you plan to acquire concealed carry permits, it may be important depending on where you live, to take a particular kind of course with a particular kind of certificate at the end. Many states require proof of proficiency, which you can sometimes provide with such a certificate. This is a highly localized thing, so you will have to research that independently.

As an NRA member, I am biased towards taking classes from them. My first training class was run by a local shooting range, and provided a training certificate at the end. The course covered all the basics of firearms safety, as well as components on the use of deadly force, anatomy of different kinds of firearms, etc. The course included several nights of classroom instruction, and three days at the range. The range days were split up between pistol, rifle and shotgun.

<p>Generally you should decide on pistol, rifle, or shotgun. I don't know of any no-previous-experience courses which will teach more than one in a single course. Then, you need to decide what it is you're looking to get out of the course. Do you want classroom-only instruction that teaches the basics of a firearm operation, maintenance and safety? Do you want to actually spend time shooting a firearm?</p>

<p>I typically advise people to find a local NRA Basic course (there are Basic Pistol, Basic Shotgun, and Basic Rifle courses). Many local shooting ranges offer them. Some people complain they are too long for beginners, but for a comprehensive introduction, I like them. Because of the length complaint, many instructors will offer a cut down version called something like "First Steps". A great resource for finding ocal instruction is: <a href="http://www.nssf.org/shooting/learn/" rel="nofollow">NSSF: Learn to Shoot</a></p>

<p>As for what to watch out for, I'd say to trust your gut. At the complete beginner level, I would steer clear of any class that seems overly concerned with being cool or elite. Talk to the instructor beforehand even over email if that's all you can manage. Ask how the class is run, how they deal with safety, etc. Get a vibe. If you don't click, don't take that class. I do have one concrete warning. Be cautious about anyone saying they "play by big boy rules". There are several great instructors who use this to mean they follow the widely accepted rules of firearms safety while having a hot range. Unfortunately I've heard of many new training outfits using this same phrase to describe training scenarios that look like an horrible accident waiting to happen. If someone says that, ask them to clarify. If they won't clarify find someone else.</p>

I would recommend leaning towards an NRA Certified Instructor.
