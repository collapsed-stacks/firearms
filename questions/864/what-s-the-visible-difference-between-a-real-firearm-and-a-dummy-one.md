Suppose I buy a dummy firearm like dummy M-16 rifle (completely legal where I live, while a real M-16 is prohibited). It looks mostly like a full-blown real firearm - all parts have the same size and the weight is the same as of a real one.

Suppose a police officer asks me to prove that it's indeed a dummy firearm. How do I do that? What will be the visible difference?
