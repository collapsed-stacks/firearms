If I were to choose fiber optic (also known as "high-viz" sights) over proper night-sights, would I receive any benefit, in extremely low level light conditions, over iron sights? Or is it better, for self-defense purposes, to spend the extra money and get proper night-sights?

If self-defense is the object, I REALLY wouldn't skimp on the sights. Night sights are a proven benefit in all lighting. I used them to increase my sight picture during the day. So, I'd say, don't make a decision based on saving a few bucks, when you are talking about defending your life.

Fiber optic sights rely upon the ambient light (are light collectors - I tried them and wasn't happy), night sights use a light emitter. I have tritium sights and I can see them in the dark (never tried them in total darkness  - a cave - but I'm certain that they would function).

Here's a youTube demonstration of the difference in the two types:

I am not really a fan of fiber-optic sights on a defensive firearm.  Many of them are quite fragile.  I have had multiple students loose the fiber optic element out of their front sight during classes.  From a durability standpoint alone, I would stay away from most of them on a fighting gun.
