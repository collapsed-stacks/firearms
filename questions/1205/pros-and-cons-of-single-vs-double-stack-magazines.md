I my April edition of *American Rifleman*, I see that Springfield is offering a single-stack version of the XD line of handguns.

Beyond thickness of the grip, what are the benefits and detriments of single- and double-stacked magazines?

Thickness of the grip is the primary concern. Some people find it easier to conceal a single-stack versus a double-stack, while others would rather risk printing in order to carry an additional handful of rounds.

In theory, if there were such a thing as a single-stack AR-15, that would eliminate a feed ramp -- there would be one in the center as opposed to on on each side. I think double-stack XD magazines are designed in such a way that this is not a concern -- the next round is forced to the center in order to feed better. I believe this is also the case for Hi-Power and Glock magazines.

Thickness of the grip and ammunition capacity are the primary concerns. Ammunition capacity is pretty clear - all else being equal, more rounds are better. There is also weight - bigger grips and magazines with more rounds lead to a heavier loaded weight, which may be a concern.

Grip size and shape is an issue as well. Grip size can affect concealability, but I think that a good fit to the shooter's hand is more important. It's possible for a person of any hand size to hold and fire a pistol of any grip size, but accuracy and recoil control are much better when the barrel axis is lined up with the arm bones of the shooter when the gun is held in a firing grip. This may not be possible if the grip is too large or small for the shooter's hand.

For example, I have relatively small hands, and I cannot get a really good grip like this on many double-stack pistols with mainsprings in the grip, such as the Beretta 92 series, especially when I also need to be able to reach the long, heavy double-action trigger. On the other hand, I know several shooters with large hands who prefer these larger-gripped pistols. Caliber is a factor too - double-stack 45-caliber pistols have even larger grips than double-stack 9mms.
