I believe congress passed a law allowing the importation of M1 Garands from South Korea. Has there been any further news on this? Is any info on condition/pricing/timeline available yet?

There doesn't seem to be a lot of definitive information on these at the moment, but apparently the Korean Garands [have finally been approved](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/01/116_103154.html) for import by the US Government. Orest Michaels from the CMP released a [statement](http://odcmp.com/Emails/12/Sales012312.htm) back in January basically saying that since CMP is not an importer, they will not be getting any of these for their sales program. My guess is that they'll eventually come through one of the large importers like Century. Total quantity is rumored to be around 86,000 rifles, but their condition and eventual price are currently unknown.
