I'm in the market for an entry level 1911 and I'm wondering what characteristics I should be looking for. 

Where can I skimp? 

What should I look for to know that it will be a firearm that I can upgrade in the future?

 - Trigger?
 - Front/Rear Sight?


It's difficult to discern between:

 - Basic Necessities 
 - Match Grade Characteristics
 - Fluff
