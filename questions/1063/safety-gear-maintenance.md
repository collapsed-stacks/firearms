What is the best way to keep ear plugs (the baffle kind), ear muffs, and safety glasses clean after range time?

I've never seen instructions on the packages for muffs and plugs for how to keep them usable and clean, and am curious to know if the polycarbonate lenses need any special care that is different from sunglasses, spectacles, etc.
