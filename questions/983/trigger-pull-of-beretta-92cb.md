The 92CB was a competition model of the 92FS that was also briefly adopted by the Italian COMSUBIN (the Italian Navy special operations group).  Unlike the 92FS, the CB is a single action pistol (with double action double strike capability) with a frame mounted safety.  Trigger weight is at or just below the stated weight for standard 92FS guns.  Information that I have, very few CBs were imported to the US market.

Google failed me when I tried to find any sources to back this up, but I know the M9 sports about a 12 pound double-action pull and about a five-pound single-action pull. I don't imagine many of the variants would depart from that setup, but don't take my word for it if someone corrects me.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92G-SD/96G-SD#Technical_data_.E2.80.93_92G-SD" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> page indicates the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trigger Pull: Single Action: 4.0 to 6.4 lbf (18 to 28 N) Double Action: 9.9 to 16.1 lbf (44 to 72 N)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your manual <em>should</em> have more information regarding your particular model.</p>
