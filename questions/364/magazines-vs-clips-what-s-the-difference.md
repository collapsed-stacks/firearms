In a different question, I saw the comment that magazines and clips are different things.  What are each (and by extension, what is the difference)?

<p>A magazine uses mechanical energy (e.g. a spring) to feed the next round. A clip just holds rounds in place, often times to assist in loading a magazine (see en bloc clip or stripper clip).</p>

<p><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong></p>

<p>"A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_%28ammunition%29">clip</a> is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine or cylinder of a firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time."</p>

<p>"A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_%28firearms%29">magazine</a> is an ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a repeating firearm. Magazines may be integral to the firearm (fixed) or removable (detachable). The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into a position where they may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm." </p>

Clips load magazines; magazines load firearms.
