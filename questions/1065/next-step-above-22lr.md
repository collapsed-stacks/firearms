If I want to try something a little more accurate than .22LR without getting outrageously expensive, what would be a good round to look at? (Just for shooting paper targets at the range)

If your baseline for price is .22LR, I think you're going to have trouble finding anything even close in price. I would look at more accurate .22LR. Federal makes a "Champion Target 22LR" that is often about $0.05 per round. But you can also get more expensive ones like  CCI's Velocitor and Lapua Speed Ace, but those are often $0.13 - $0.20 per round.

In a rifle the 17HMR is a great option.  At the ranges that you'd shoot a .22 most of the .17's will shoot very accurately.  After that I'd make the bigger jump up to .223.
