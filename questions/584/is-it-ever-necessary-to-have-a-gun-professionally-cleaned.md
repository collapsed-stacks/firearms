## Is it ever necessary to have a gun professionally cleaned?

I just bought my first gun, a Springfield XD 9mm, from Gander Mountain a few months ago.  The sales guy offered an extended warranty for $30 and said that it comes with a free cleaning ($60 value).  I never buy extended warranties because I think they're a waste of money.  But this one actually came with something of value (even if that value is likely overstated), so I figured, why not?

So I'm wondering if it is actually necessary to have a handgun professionally cleaned (apparently they take apart the action, cleaning it more thoroughly than a field-strip), and if so, how often?  I've probably shot about 2,500 rounds through the gun, and I clean it after every trip to the range.

Honestly, no. If you shot the gun every now and then and threw it into your glovebox and never cleaned it (just squirted some oil on it whenever), a professional cleaning might do you good after a decade or so. It sounds like you're taking good care of your gun. The action really isn't likely to get gummed up at all; I like to drip a little bit of oil on the springs and rotation points every now and again just to prevent any corrosion.

A professional cleaning would benefit you if you had an antique you were trying to restore, but a modern handgun that's been well looked after will function reliably for a long time with basic cleaning and lubrication.

<p>If you're at all mechanically inclined you can readily break down your firearm as far as a professional will.  You can find instructions <a href="http://www.xd-hs2000.com/disassembly/disassembly.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  I like to do a thorough cleaning about every 4000 rounds.</p>

The short answer here is No.
The long answer is that the 9mm XD's have endured torture tests of thousands of rounds without cleaning, and in harsh environment, and compromised by particulate matter, and the list goes on.
Field strip your XD(m), remove the barrel and operating rod/spring assembly.  Spray down the upper, the rod/spring, and the upper with brake cleaner or carb cleaner.  lightly lubricate the spring assembly, a drop or two of 40 weight synthetic, clp, eezox, etc. on a cotton cloth or old t-shirt is more than sufficient.  Put a drop directly on the cam and block, and a drop in the grooves on each side that hold the upper on.  Reassemble and rack the weapon while empty several times to distribute the oil.
