I just bought my first gun, a Springfield XD 9mm, from Gander Mountain a few months ago.  The sales guy offered an extended warranty for $30 and said that it comes with a free cleaning ($60 value).  I never buy extended warranties because I think they're a waste of money.  But this one actually came with something of value (even if that value is likely overstated), so I figured, why not?

So I'm wondering if it is actually necessary to have a handgun professionally cleaned (apparently they take apart the action, cleaning it more thoroughly than a field-strip), and if so, how often?  I've probably shot about 2,500 rounds through the gun, and I clean it after every trip to the range.
