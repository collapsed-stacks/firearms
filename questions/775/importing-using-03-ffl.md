A type 03-FFL allows you to [import C&R firearms](http://www.atf.gov/firearms/guides/importation-verification/general-information-types-of-importers.html) into the U.S. for your personal collection. Can anyone who has done this explain what the process is and how it differs from purchasing a firearm within the U.S.?
