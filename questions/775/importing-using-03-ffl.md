<p>A type 03-FFL allows you to <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/guides/importation-verification/general-information-types-of-importers.html" rel="nofollow">import C&amp;R firearms</a> into the U.S. for your personal collection. Can anyone who has done this explain what the process is and how it differs from purchasing a firearm within the U.S.?</p>

<p>You can import C&amp;R eligible firearms on your 03 FFL.  Basically, the added step is approval from State and the BATFE via an <a href="http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-3a.pdf" rel="nofollow">ATF Form 6 - Part 1 (5330.3A)</a>.  </p>

<p>From the form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Federal firearms licensee, other than an importer, may make an
  occasional importation of sporting firearms or ammunition (<em>excluding
  surplus military</em>) for himself or an unlicensed person in the
  licensee's State, provided that the firearms and ammunition are
  intended for personal use of the person for whom imported and not for
  resale. ATF Form 6 - Part I (5330.3A is used to obtain approval for such importation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>03 is not a licensed importer (08 or 11 FFL), and we can assume that the mention of importing for others refers to 01-FFLs, but 03s can import for their personal collections.</p>
