A type 03-FFL allows you to [import C&R firearms](http://www.atf.gov/firearms/guides/importation-verification/general-information-types-of-importers.html) into the U.S. for your personal collection. Can anyone who has done this explain what the process is and how it differs from purchasing a firearm within the U.S.?

You can import C&R eligible firearms on your 03 FFL.  Basically, the added step is approval from State and the BATFE via an [ATF Form 6 - Part 1 (5330.3A)](http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-3a.pdf).  

From the form:

> A Federal firearms licensee, other than an importer, may make an
> occasional importation of sporting firearms or ammunition (*excluding
> surplus military*) for himself or an unlicensed person in the
> licensee's State, provided that the firearms and ammunition are
> intended for personal use of the person for whom imported and not for
> resale. ATF Form 6 - Part I (5330.3A is used to obtain approval for such importation.

03 is not a licensed importer (08 or 11 FFL), and we can assume that the mention of importing for others refers to 01-FFLs, but 03s can import for their personal collections.
