What are the best ways to both field clean and detail clean and maintain a lever action gun? Specifically on a Winchester model 94.

For a field clean, a cable based cleaning kit would probably be best. Something like Otis or maybe Hoppe's Bore Snake. You can clean from the breach forward without removing the lever and bolt on Marlin style lever actions or pulling side plates on some of the others and you won't have to try to flex a rod to slip it in through the open action.  

*Edit:* For a detail strip of the model 94, this [guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjPlLQf73gQ) has a two part video that does a better job showing it than I could describing it. Watch your magazine tube spring and keep your screws and pins in order as you remove them.
