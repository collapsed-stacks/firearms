In the course of trying to find a lighter recoil spring to solve the [problems with my conversion barrel](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1073/problems-with-lone-wolf-conversion-barrel-in-glock-22) I've discovered that [Glock has issued a voluntary recall of Gen 4 recoil spring assemblies](http://us.glock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange). However, I haven't seen any indication of *why*.

What problems were people encountering that led to this recall? I'm curious since I haven't had any problems with mine except when using the conversion barrel.
