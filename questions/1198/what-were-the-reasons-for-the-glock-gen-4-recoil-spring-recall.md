In the course of trying to find a lighter recoil spring to solve the [problems with my conversion barrel](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1073/problems-with-lone-wolf-conversion-barrel-in-glock-22) I've discovered that [Glock has issued a voluntary recall of Gen 4 recoil spring assemblies](http://us.glock.com/customer-service/recoil-spring-exchange). However, I haven't seen any indication of *why*.

What problems were people encountering that led to this recall? I'm curious since I haven't had any problems with mine except when using the conversion barrel.

Gen 4 Glocks, especially in 9mm, have had issues with erratic ejections and frequent failures to eject.  This does not affect all guns, and it is usually more prominent with weaker ammunition.  The recoil spring recall was one attempt to fix this problem, but it was not successful for all affected pistols.

Glock has since modified the ejector (not extractor) to address the same problem, although this part has not been recalled.

It only affected the first releases of the Gen4s, something to do with the recoil spring being too weak. Glock fixed the problem right away so if you purchased your Gen 4 after two months of the initial release date then you most likely have the updated part.
