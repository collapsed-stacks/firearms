I presume a lathe is needed, but what specific tools are needed to craft barrels?

Are they different for handguns than rifles or shotguns?

If so, what would be needed to setup a shop to be able to work on all three?

Check out

http://riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/making_rifle_barrel.htm

Looks like you'll need:

 * deep hole driller
 * reamer
 * rifling solution - button or shaving

Pretty significant tooling investment, might as well throw a subscription
to the http://www.homeshopmachinist.net  to boot.

A much shorter path towards firearms building is one of the "expedient"  build guides like this one, http://thehomegunsmith.com/, just don't build the automatic version. There are forums dedicated to firearms building, your question should find a better audience there and something like this is likely answered in the FAQ. Good luck!

The best fixture for making barrels isn't a shop lathe, it's a custom machine.  They're not small, but they can be surprisingly easy to make.  

The machine is basically a special-purpose lathe with a long chuck (in order to hold the stock concentrically over its length).  You'll need a high-pressure oil system in order to run the gunn drill (deep hole drill).  Then a reamer (no biggie), then a rifling head.  If you wish to do cut rifling, some indexing features are needed.

While not really plans, there's enough information in [This Guy Lautard Video](http://lautard.com/rmv.htm) to construct a good machine.
