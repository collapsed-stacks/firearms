<p>I presume a lathe is needed, but what specific tools are needed to craft barrels?</p>

<p>Are they different for handguns than rifles or shotguns?</p>

<p>If so, what would be needed to setup a shop to be able to work on all three?</p>

<p>Looks like you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>deep hole driller</li>
<li>reamer</li>
<li>rifling solution - button or shaving</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty significant tooling investment, might as well throw a subscription

<p>A much shorter path towards firearms building is one of the "expedient"  build guides like this one, <a href="http://thehomegunsmith.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thehomegunsmith.com/</a>, just don't build the automatic version. There are forums dedicated to firearms building, your question should find a better audience there and something like this is likely answered in the FAQ. Good luck!</p>

<p>The best fixture for making barrels isn't a shop lathe, it's a custom machine.  They're not small, but they can be surprisingly easy to make.  </p>

<p>The machine is basically a special-purpose lathe with a long chuck (in order to hold the stock concentrically over its length).  You'll need a high-pressure oil system in order to run the gunn drill (deep hole drill).  Then a reamer (no biggie), then a rifling head.  If you wish to do cut rifling, some indexing features are needed.</p>

<p>While not really plans, there's enough information in <a href="http://lautard.com/rmv.htm" rel="nofollow">This Guy Lautard Video</a> to construct a good machine.  </p>
