What are the **disadvantages / advantages** to a specific **barrel weight**? Obviously light weight barrels save weight, but is there a practical reduction of durability or anything? I am specifically talking about AR-15s, although I assume the advantages / disadvantages would be the same no matter the weapon. Thanks!
