When a shooting range is portrayed in a movie the characters often wear safety goggles made of slightly colored plastic. I often see such goggles on display in local gun shops.

The "slightly colored" part is easy - it's to increase contrast and give better visibility. However the goggles are almost always designed to extensively cover the eyes from all angles. They are clearly intended to protect against something yet they're also clearly not strong enough to protect against being shot.

What exactly are they designed to protect against?
