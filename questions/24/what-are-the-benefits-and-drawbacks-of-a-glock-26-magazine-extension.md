<p>I have a Glock 26.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QQXFc.gif" alt="Glock 26 Picture"></p>

<p>I chose this model because it has a shorter handle than other models of Glock and so it conceals better.</p>

<p>I don't mind the trade off of grip stability when I'm carrying this weapon concealed. When I take this pistol to the range, though, I'd like to be able to include my pinky finger in my grip of the weapon.</p>

<p>I've seen magazine attachments like this one online:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IDbAe.png" alt="Magazine Extension Picture"></p>

<p>They don't add any additional capacity to the magazine, they just extend the grip to simulate a regular handle.</p>

<p>My question is, do these third party add-ons have a good track record?  Do they fasten securely?</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using such an add-on?</p>

<p>Like any other 3rd party add on,the quality will depend on the manufacturer. So personally I would do some research, and try to make an informed decision on the one I buy. Also they do tend to be cheap enough you could just buy 3 or 4 and find one that works for your grip. </p>

<p>I would say though, if you are going to be carrying concealed and using this as your defense weapon, you shouldn't practice with a grip extension if you are not going carry it with one. </p>

<p>As far as advantages, with a grip extender you are going to have a more stable platform if you have a bigger hand. And since you have more hand on the grip, you have more control over the firearm. </p>

<p>Disadvantages, well since it is not part of the mag, you are going to have issue changing mags in a timely fashion. </p>

<p>Personally I would look for a magazine that <em>includes</em> the grip extender instead of one that fits over the current grip. </p>

<p>I can't speak to the quality or utility of using a grip extension on your G26, what I can address is the practical use of the product.  If you carry concealed with the standard length, 10 round magazines – that is what you should train and practice with.  Your training and familiarity will build consistency that your hand and brain will expect in the unfortunate circumstance that you need to use your firearm in a lawful self defense scenario.  It will feel “wrong” if you spend a considerable amount of time training with the device and it isn't there when you carry concealed.  This “wrong” feeling will most likely result in your brain telling you to adjust your grip to make it feel more familiar, losing precious moments during your encounter.</p>

<p>If you carry it – train with it.
If you train with it – carry it.</p>

<p>I've shot a Glock 36 (subcompact .45) with a magazine extender and it was pretty comfortable.  I tried to shoot it without the extender and it was extremely uncomfortable (I have fairly large hands).  I've never heard anything negative about them and from what it felt like, the extender wasn't going to budge from the magazine.</p>

<p>Also, on Glock subcompacts, the entire frame is smaller and the barrel is shorter than a compact, which is still smaller and shorter than the standard.  So it's going to kick a little more than the larger versions; all the more reason to get the extender.</p>

<p>I have a Walther PPK with a magazine with an extender mounted on the bottom. There are a few differences that I have noticed:</p>

<p>With the extender, it is easier to switch mags that don't fall out immediately, because you have something to pull on.  </p>

<p>Without it the gun is slightly shorter top/bottom (about 1/2" - 1" depending on the type), thus easier to conceal and less likely to catch when drawing out of a pocket or such.  </p>

<p>For me the extender doesn't make much of a difference for comfort/stability while shooting.</p>
