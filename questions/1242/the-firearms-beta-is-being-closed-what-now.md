<p>So this site is closing down permanently on May 4th, 2012. I would like to invite all who have participated on this site to join <a href="http://www.thehighroad.org" rel="nofollow">thehighroad.org</a> , it is a firearms forum that I have been apart of for some time. People ask very similar questions to the ones posted here and receive very similar answers. </p>
