I've been interested in shooting and firearms for a long time, and am finally getting my license. While I wait for it to arrive in the mail, I've been doing a lot of window shopping and price comparisons and can see this as becoming a very addictive hobby. I eventually plan on owning at least one 9mm and 45acp pistol

However, I've been unable to come to terms with where to start. I am a Canadian, so any future firearm will be used for range shooting/target shooting

I've heard from one party that starting with a .22lr is a valuable way to build up experience without spending much money on ammunition.

I've heard from another party that the skills learned shooting a .22lr (ie control of muzzle lift, tilt, recoil) do not transfer over very well when graduating to a 9mm or 45acp. His suggestion was to skip the .22lr pistol altogether and start with the 9mm

My question is, what would an experienced shooter recommend? Would it be more valuable to have the 22 experience before moving to a larger calibre, or should I save the cost of the 22 pistol and start with the 9mm?

I realize this is a subjective question, but i'm looking for input from experienced shooters.
