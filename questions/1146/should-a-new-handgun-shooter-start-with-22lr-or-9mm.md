## Should a new handgun shooter start with .22LR or 9mm?

<p>I've been interested in shooting and firearms for a long time, and am finally getting my license. While I wait for it to arrive in the mail, I've been doing a lot of window shopping and price comparisons and can see this as becoming a very addictive hobby. I eventually plan on owning at least one 9mm and 45acp pistol</p>

<p>However, I've been unable to come to terms with where to start. I am a Canadian, so any future firearm will be used for range shooting/target shooting</p>

<p>I've heard from one party that starting with a .22lr is a valuable way to build up experience without spending much money on ammunition.</p>

<p>I've heard from another party that the skills learned shooting a .22lr (ie control of muzzle lift, tilt, recoil) do not transfer over very well when graduating to a 9mm or 45acp. His suggestion was to skip the .22lr pistol altogether and start with the 9mm</p>

<p>My question is, what would an experienced shooter recommend? Would it be more valuable to have the 22 experience before moving to a larger calibre, or should I save the cost of the 22 pistol and start with the 9mm?</p>

<p>I realize this is a subjective question, but i'm looking for input from experienced shooters.</p>

<p>Selection of a pistol is a personal decision.  It's a bit like asking what kind of car you should get.  The best one for me might not work for you.  Ideally you want to try before you buy and see which one feels the best for you.  At least hold it in your hand if you can't shoot it.</p>

<p>That being said, everyone I know who owns a pistol purely for target shooting (not defense or hunting) has the Ruger Mark3.  It's incredibly comfortable to shoot and highly accurate.  However, they also have a lot of trouble with higher caliber weapons.  If you're accustomed to a .45 it's very easy to shoot a .22, but not the other way around.  A good compromise is to get a .22 conversion kit so you can get cheap ammo, but still get some practice with the higher caliber.</p>

<p>I'd vote for 9mm, but only because I'm picking between the two options given.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting with a .40 or .45.  I like starting shooters with a centerfire handgun round, because then they can develop form in dry fire (what a .22 would give you) but still acclimate to a 'real' pistol.  .22 is a lot of fun, but it is inadequate in preparing shooters for a centerfire handgun, and often people trained on the .22 have extra discomfort with the centerfire pistol because they've developed habits which work fine with a .22 but are poor for a real caliber.  Training does work in the opposite direction: people trained on centerfire pistols do fine with a .22.</p>

<p>I think if you have the opportunity to test fire them at a range first, you should absolutely take advantage of that, because as Karl^ says, it is absolutely a personal decision. The 9mm will have a little more power to it, but you have to go with what you are most comfortable with. I will say though that before having a lot of experience shooting my first handgun was a <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/sr9/models.html" rel="nofollow">Ruger SR9</a> and it was a great investment. Not too fancy, but not cheap either. Multiple safety features and great accuracy all things considered. 17 round clip doesn't hurt either. Other than that very easy to strip and clean. 
Anyway I hope you enjoy your new firearm, stay safe and protected. Best.</p>

<p>A new shooter who is starting to learn firearms safety, marksmanship and responsibility should begin with a .22 cal.  Twenty twos are cheap, easy and fun to shoot.  All of the important basics can be acquired and honed with a .22 without having to contend with significant recoil (the less fun part) or a .45 inch sized hole in your foot (the much less fun part). Move next to the 9mm and last to the .45.  I love my .45 cal Kimber.  I love to fire my 9mm Glock after a few rounds with the .45.  After the .45, the Glock feels like a .22 and is so controllable and accurate.  The suggestion of buying a .22 conversion kit is a good one.  I have one for my 9mm and use it to practice trigger control, marksmanship and to keep my wife involved in shooting.  Find a range that rents guns and shoot as many types and calibers as it takes to make you comfortable enough to make your decision.  And...have fun!</p>
