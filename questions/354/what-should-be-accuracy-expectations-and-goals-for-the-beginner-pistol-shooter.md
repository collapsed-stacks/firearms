I've been shooting Glock 17 for last couple of months on averagy at 100 rounds per week. I am getting about 50% of my shots at 15 yards in 8'' target. I feel that it's pretty bad but I have no true reference point. So can someoneone more experienced share their thoughts on accuracy expectation at different distances? I think it can be very useful info for many beginners.

To clarify the question. I am looking for some meaningful reference point that can be used to set shooting training goals. Lets assume that we are talking about average mammal in good health and not too young or old who is willing to invest some time and effort into learning how to shoot.

More to the point. From my martial arts training experience, if new person asks 'when am I going to be a black belt?' that can't be answered as it's very specific to individual abilities and commitment. However, question 'On average, how long will it take for the regular person who is training reasonably hard to attain black belt level in this group?' is totally answerable. And the beginner can set the goal of reaching certain level and work toward that goal while measuring progress.

For shooting I just want a recommendation on how to quantify my progress and what my goal should be, for example, in a year.
