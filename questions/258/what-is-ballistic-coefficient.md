In regards to accuracy, I've seen a lot of forums reference the Ballistic Coefficient of a specific bullet.  What is this and is it something that can be calculated on the fly if I'm at the range?  Is it affected by anything in the rifle itself, such as 1/7 twist or 1/12 twist or is it solely based on the bullet itself?  Is it affected by the amount or type of powder in the round?
