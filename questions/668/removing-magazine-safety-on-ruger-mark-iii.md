<p>The easiest way I've found is to replace the hammer and hammer bushing with equivalent parts from the Mark II. As you can see below the difference has to do with the notch in the hammer where the hammer bushing is installed:</p>

<p>If you've got more time than money and feel like tinkering, you can also achieve the same result by <a href="http://guntalk-online.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=387" rel="nofollow">shaping a couple of regular washers</a> to fill the notch:</p>

<p>A few particularly handy people have machined custom hammer bushings, but all I've found appear to have been overwhelmed by requests and stopped offering them:</p>
