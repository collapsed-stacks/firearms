<p>Without the tag I'm not sure I can tell the difference between these two. What's actually different between them other than the name? Are the parts interchangeable?</p>

<p>As I understand it, the Marlin 336 was rebranded as the 30, 30A, and 30W and sold through various big retailers. Internally, it's the same firearm. The differences are all cosmetic. The biggest of difference is the wood used. The 336 has walnut, while the 30s are just walnut-stained.</p>
