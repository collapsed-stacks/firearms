In an auto-loading shotgun, the recoil spring goes into the stock. Because of this, is it at all possible to put a stock-less pistol grip on a semi-auto shotgun. I've seen this done in movies, but those are movies. Thoughts?

<p>Not all semi-auto shotguns are recoil operated, some have gas-operated actions. Although some may have buffer tubes in the stock, at least a few do not. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saiga-12" rel="nofollow">Saiga-12</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelli_M4" rel="nofollow">Benelli M4</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12" rel="nofollow">SPAS-12</a> all have examples with folding stocks so it's at least possible with them.</p>

<p>UPDATE (about the Rem 1100/11-87 and Mossberg 930 or any other specific gun):
I don't have any specific knowledge about these guns. I did do some research on the Internet combined with some intuition. It's much more common to see folding stocks than pistol-grip only stocks and I reasoned that if a folding stock worked so would a pistol-grip only stock. As your question indicated, the problem is usually whether or not there is a buffer tube or spring tube in the OEM stock that would prevent you from putting something like a pistol-grip only stock on. To figure this out, you can search for "folding stock Remington 11-87". Or, the owner's manuals often have an exploded parts diagram that will clearly show a spring tube if it exists and those owner's manuals are often available online from the manufacturer. </p>

<p>Some examples: 
For the Rem 11-87/1100. <a href="http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx</a> had this image in the manual. The part labeled <code>7</code> is an <code>Action Spring Tube</code></p>

<p>For the Mossberg 930, <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/content.asp?ID=520&amp;section=service" rel="nofollow">http://www.mossberg.com/content.asp?ID=520&amp;section=service</a> has a manual with a similar image also showing a spring tube extending into the OEM stock that probably prevents using a pistol-grip only stock.</p>

Technical issues aside, you'll want to check the laws in your area on this as well. For example, in Minnesota, a semi-automatic shotgun magically becomes a "military-style assault weapon" if it has at least two of the following:

 - Folding or telecoping stock
 - Pistol grip
 - Fixed magazine capacity exceeding five rounds
 - ability to accept detachable magazine

This doesn't make them totally illegal, but can require some extra paperwork.
