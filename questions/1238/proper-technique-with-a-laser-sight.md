<p>I recently purchased the Crimson Trace Laserguard to go with my Taurus TCP.  While practicing with it, my first time ever shooting with a laser, I noticed a tendency to look at it instead of the regular sights, which is pretty much the point I think.  However, I also noticed I would drop my arms slightly to get the regular sights out of the way.</p>

<p>This felt "wrong" because of how I've been taught to shoot, but also seemed logical under the circumstances.  Is there a generally accepted "correct" way to shoot with a laser?  What's the reasoning behind it?</p>

<p>Your thinking is correct, you are no longer using the regular sights. However you do want to hold the pistol in a similar fashion to how you shoot it with iron sights. The best method for this is to shoot the pistol like you normally would but lift your head up so you are looking over the top of the iron sights, focusing purely on the laser.</p>

<p>As far as your arms go you don't want to drop them at all, this will make your shooting position less secure. In other words, no bending your elbows. You instead just raise your head up and look just over the top of the iron sights as previously mentioned. </p>
