I recently purchased the Crimson Trace Laserguard to go with my Taurus TCP.  While practicing with it, my first time ever shooting with a laser, I noticed a tendency to look at it instead of the regular sights, which is pretty much the point I think.  However, I also noticed I would drop my arms slightly to get the regular sights out of the way.

This felt "wrong" because of how I've been taught to shoot, but also seemed logical under the circumstances.  Is there a generally accepted "correct" way to shoot with a laser?  What's the reasoning behind it?
