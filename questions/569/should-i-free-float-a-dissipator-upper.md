## Should I free-float a dissipator upper?

The appeal of the dissipator as a KISS rifle stems from its weight and length reduction compared to a standard rifle while maintaining long sight radius and length of pull.

All my ARs are free-floated (admittedly more as a function of OCD than practical need). I'd like a dissipator style upper, but with a mid-length gas system and a free-floated barrel.  

The mid length gas system on its own is easy enough to achieve, but the free-float looks a little more problematic.

There are a few companies who make free float tubes that accept standard hand-guards for National Match competition, but they are made for use on barrels with rifle length gas systems and are relatively heavy.

I guess the crux of my question is do the added weight of the NM tube and the fact that the front sight tower is still barrel mounted negate the value free-floating the barrel for a dissipator style upper?

<p>Be honest with yourself. Is it just a range toy, or are you shooting competitively? If it's a range toy, then do what makes you happy. <a href="http://www.bravocompanyusa.com/Free-Floating-Tactical-Handguards-s/54.htm" rel="nofollow">Bravo Company</a> makes some free-float mid length handguards, if that's what floats your boat.</p>

<p>If you're shooting competitively over long distances, then the free float handguards will improve your accuracy and repeatability. The effect will be less noticeable than if you were using a receiver-mounted optic.</p>
