I inherited my grandpa's old Remington Model 11 and I'd like to clean it before I shoot it again. I found a video on disassembly, but it looks like you have to take every screw out of the gun before you pull the bolt out. I don't want to completely disassemble the gun every time I shoot it, does anyone have a manual for one of these or have any suggestions on how to clean it without an hour of work?
