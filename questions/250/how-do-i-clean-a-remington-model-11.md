I inherited my grandpa's old Remington Model 11 and I'd like to clean it before I shoot it again. I found a video on disassembly, but it looks like you have to take every screw out of the gun before you pull the bolt out. I don't want to completely disassemble the gun every time I shoot it, does anyone have a manual for one of these or have any suggestions on how to clean it without an hour of work?

For your initial cleaning, I'd suggest you follow the video. Remington has a copy of the manual on their [site](http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx) (Terrible quality scan) under the manuals page [here](http://www.remington.com/~/media/Files/Owners-Manuals/Model%2011.ashx). and after hopping around the pages, the disassembly process looks to be about the same as the 15 minute video put up by [downeastgunworks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAPY84sR1wY). After your initial cleaning, in general use, Browning suggests simply pulling and cleaning the barrel on the Model 5 (same shotgun as the Remington 11).
