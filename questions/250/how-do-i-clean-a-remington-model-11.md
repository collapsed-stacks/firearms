<p>I inherited my grandpa's old Remington Model 11 and I'd like to clean it before I shoot it again. I found a video on disassembly, but it looks like you have to take every screw out of the gun before you pull the bolt out. I don't want to completely disassemble the gun every time I shoot it, does anyone have a manual for one of these or have any suggestions on how to clean it without an hour of work?</p>

<p>For your initial cleaning, I'd suggest you follow the video. Remington has a copy of the manual on their <a href="http://www.remington.com/pages/news-and-resources/downloads/owners-manuals.aspx" rel="nofollow">site</a> (Terrible quality scan) under the manuals page <a href="http://www.remington.com/~/media/Files/Owners-Manuals/Model%2011.ashx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. and after hopping around the pages, the disassembly process looks to be about the same as the 15 minute video put up by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAPY84sR1wY" rel="nofollow">downeastgunworks</a>. After your initial cleaning, in general use, Browning suggests simply pulling and cleaning the barrel on the Model 5 (same shotgun as the Remington 11). </p>
