I've seen some places offering AR-15 magazines with either CS or SS springs. What does that mean, and why would you choose one over the other?

Chrome Silicon and Stainless Steel

The idea of using CS v. SS comes down to lifespan, corrosion resistance and cost.

CS demonstrates a longer lifespan compared to SS in the identical application.  Springs age from repeated compression and decompression cycles and CS springs will take longer to take a set.

SS is not as tolerant of the same duty life, but has better corrosion resistance and at times, lower cost than CS counterparts.

Depending on the use and application of where the springs are used - in the AR15/M4 series, the most frequently changed springs in the preventive maint cycle are the buffer spring, extractor spring and magazine spring.  Depending on the desired duty life of the spring and where the firearm will be used should guide your spring selection.
