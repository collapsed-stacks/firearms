Besides Benelli are there any left handed, semi-auto shotguns manufactured?  I have seen some pumps that eject out the bottom but not a semi.

<p>Only other one I can find is an Akkar Model 600, listed in <a href="http://akkar-usa.com/AKKAR-USA.pdf" rel="nofollow">their pdf catalog</a>. I don't know anything about the brand but it's listed for sale on a number of websites.</p>
