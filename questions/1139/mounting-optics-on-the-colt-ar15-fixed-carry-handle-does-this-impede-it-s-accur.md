## Mounting optics on the Colt AR15 Fixed Carry handle, does this impede it's accuracy?

I have a Colt Match Target AR-15 rifle. It's got the fixed carry handle. I have a somewhat inexpensive red dot style aperture sight. I think it looks kind of goofy way up high on the handle, but so far it seems to function fine. Does mounting the optics higher off the barrel make it less accurate? I've seen other AR-15 rifles that don't have the fixed carry handle, that have their optics mounted lower on the weapon. I think this looks a lot better aesthetically, but are there other reasons it's better or worse?
