What is the best way to ensure that the gas port in the barrel and the gas port in the front sight of an AR-15 are aligned correctly?

All the gas blocks/front sight bases that I've seen and worked with have a hole in them that's much larger than the gas port in the barrel, which allows for a margin of error when installing a new gas block.

There's a company called <a href="http://www.brdengineering.com/">BLACK RIFLE DISEASE ENGINEERING</a> that makes a jig for aligning it properly. They sell them through <a href="http://www.brownells.com/.aspx/cid=0/k=black+rifle+disease/t=P/ksubmit=y/Products/All/search=black_rifle_disease">Brownells</a> and <a href="http://www.bravocompanyusa.com/SearchResults.asp?mfg=BRDE">Bravo Company</a>.

Additionally, if you don't feel like buying a jig there is a <a href="http://www.m4carbine.net/showthread.php?t=835">question about this</a> with various answers on the m4carbine.net forums. Some of the answers include:

The gas port is always in line with the indexing pin on the barrel extension, ensuring that the port points straight 'up'.  The gas block goes on until it bumps against a shoulder, aligning the port lengthwise along the barrel.  The final step is to make sure the gas block is straight up and down when the receiver is straight up and down.  This can be accomplished as easily as putting a level on a flat-topped gas block.  Don't overthink this, it's pretty trivial to get it right.
