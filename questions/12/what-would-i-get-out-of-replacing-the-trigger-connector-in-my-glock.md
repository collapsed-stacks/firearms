What would I get out of replacing the trigger connector in my Glock?

I am considering doing this because I hear that many people do this to every Glock they own, but I am not sure of the real world effects this would have on my pistol.

An aftermarket trigger connector can reduce the weight of the trigger pull and change the trigger reset. 

On a semi-automatic pistol, the weight of the trigger pull is amount of force required to pull the trigger until the sear is released and the gun fires. With the trigger pulled all the way back, the trigger reset is the distance you have to let the trigger move forward before the the internals reset and you can then begin pulling back and fire another cartridge. On many semi-auto pistols, the reset is not the full distance of the trigger pull.

In general, less trigger movement and less force required can help accuracy.

The connector does not change the length of the trigger pull. It changes the angle that the trigger bar travels at while pulling back on the firing pin. A higher angle increases the weight of the trigger pull and a lower angle lowers the weight. 

Doing this modification does improve the feel of the trigger. In addition the aftermarket connector is usually polished which gives you a less "gritty" feeling between the connector and the trigger bar.

<p>If you change your connector to a Ghost inc. 3.5 pound on, you should get a few benefits. </p>

<p>You will get a smoother trigger pull because it is made from polished chrome.
Your trigger pull will be lighter (5lb is standard) and this is 3.5lb.</p>

<p>If you go for a Ghost inc. 3.5lb Rocket connector, you get the above benefits and an added benefit. Trigger over travel will be almost nothing with the rocket installed.</p>
