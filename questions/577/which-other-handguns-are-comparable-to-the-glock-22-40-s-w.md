I have a friend that owns Glock 22 .40 I have gone target shooting with him and I like it pretty well.  From what I gather the price point is somewhere around $450 which is fine with me I could even go a little higher.  The rounds seem to be at reasonable prices as well.  I would be using the gun for target practice and have it at home just in case.  

The question is, what other semi auto's are similar <del>or maybe even better</del> that I should be looking at as well?
