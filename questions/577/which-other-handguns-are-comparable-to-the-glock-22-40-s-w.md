I have a friend that owns Glock 22 .40 I have gone target shooting with him and I like it pretty well.  From what I gather the price point is somewhere around $450 which is fine with me I could even go a little higher.  The rounds seem to be at reasonable prices as well.  I would be using the gun for target practice and have it at home just in case.  

The question is, what other semi auto's are similar <del>or maybe even better</del> that I should be looking at as well?

Similar guns in the same price range would include the Springfield XD and XDm, and the Smith and Wesson M&P.

<p>I have both a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_&amp;_Wesson_M&amp;P" rel="nofollow">S&amp;W M&amp;P40 Pro</a> and S&amp;W M&amp;P 40 compact.  The S&amp;W M&amp;P line are very well made and reliable pistols.  </p>

<p>I have shot my friend's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock_23" rel="nofollow">Glock 23</a>, which is a nice pistol, but I prefer the S&amp;W over the Glock 23.
I have also shot my friend's Glock 27 which I really liked, but that is a compact version which you may not be interested in.</p>

<p>I would look at the S&amp;W M&amp;P line if I were you.  At the past gun show they were even cheaper as well after I worked a deal.</p>
