Since shotgun shells are plastic, it would seem that they will have a much shorter life of reloading that will conventional brass.

How many relod cycles is typical for a shotgun shell, and what needs to be verified/checked before reloading?

I get about 5 loadings to a hull.  The part that wears out is the crimp, so that's the part to watch.  Once the mouth of the case starts getting ragged you can probably eek another load out of it, but the crimp will no longer look store-perfect.  I generally keep my hulls in 'generations' and when a significant percentage begin to produce lousy crimps I toss them.  I get only slightly longer life from premium hulls (STS Premier, Win AA).
