<p>I'm curious in the differences between these two. In particular, is a pellet lethal if fired from a cartridge gun at a distance of 10ft or greater? How far do pellets generally penetrate at this range?</p>

<p>@Bill Martin I'll assume you mean mean a pellet fired from an air pistol (if not, let me know and I'll edit this answer).  A .177" pellet (the most common kind), weighs about 10 grains (7000 grains to the pound; 10 grains is 0.65 grams).  You can expect a pellet to leave the muzzle of an air pistol in the neighbourhood of dgm's 400fps figure.</p>

<p>By ".22" you probably mean a .22 rimfire.  This cartridge has a 40 grain bullet, which fired from a pistol will have about 1000fps muzzle velocity (from a rifle you'll get about 1250fps).</p>

<p>As you can see the .22 is much more powerful - its bullet is four times as heavy as the pellet, and it is moving 2.5 times as quickly.  This gives it 25 times as much kinetic energy as the pellet.</p>

<p>At 10ft, a pellet will embed itself a well into a 3/4" thick softwood board but won't penetrate.  It will easily embed itself in flesh and it would destroy an eye.</p>

<p>At 10ft, the bullet from a .22 will completely penetrate several 3/4" thick software boards and is easily capable of producing a lethal wound.</p>
