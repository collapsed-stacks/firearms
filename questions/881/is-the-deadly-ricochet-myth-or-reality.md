Someone mentioned to me that ricochet that can kill someone is not very realistic since bullet will get deformed on the first impact and will not fly much after that.

So is ricochet a myth or reality? If ricochet happens, what kind of surface and what kind of bullet are most and least likely to cause it? What weapon is more likely to cause it, rifle or pistol?

Of course, this question is about such ricochet that bounced bullet would have enough energy to kill.
