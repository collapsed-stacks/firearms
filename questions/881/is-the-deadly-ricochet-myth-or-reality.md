Someone mentioned to me that ricochet that can kill someone is not very realistic since bullet will get deformed on the first impact and will not fly much after that.

So is ricochet a myth or reality? If ricochet happens, what kind of surface and what kind of bullet are most and least likely to cause it? What weapon is more likely to cause it, rifle or pistol?

Of course, this question is about such ricochet that bounced bullet would have enough energy to kill.

Yes, a bullet that ricochets off an intermediate barrier can retain enough energy and mass to cause grave physical injury or death.  Reality.

Ricochets can happen on almost any material of significance.  Rifle, handgun, FMJ, JHP, etc it doesn't matter.  What matters is the angle of incidence.  That angle will have a corollary to the amount of mass the projectile retains and the velocity in which it leaves the barrier.  That mass and velocity can penetrate to lethal levels.

A ricochet can be dangerous even with low energy ammunition/gun. I once shot a BB pellet from a rifle so that it hit directly on another BB embedded in the target at 50 ft. The ricochet missed my left ear by only a couple of inches.
