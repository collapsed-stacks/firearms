## Is it okay to buff a minor nick in the upper receiver, just below the feed ramp of an AR15?

I built an M4 style AR15 last year for fun and ran about 200 rounds through it. When I went to clean it, I noticed a small burr below the left feed ramp (rifle style feed ramps) where it looks like maybe a case neck caught the edge of the upper receiver and chipped it. Not deep, just enough to get through the anodizing. I haven't had a chance to bring it to the range since, but I don't think it will affect functionality. Is there any problem buffing that tiny lip smooth and should I bother spot anodizing it? Has anyone else with a rifle ramped AR noticed wear on the receiver below the ramps?
