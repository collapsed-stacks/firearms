<p>Two.  If you're running a piston system, you should clean the piston after each range session.  Advertising to the contrary, a piston system is, at best, no more reliable than a DI system and should be cleaned at least as frequently.  If you're expecting reliability you should clean your firearm regularly and note any suspicious build up as an unhandled problem and address it before it prevents your firearm from working. </p>
