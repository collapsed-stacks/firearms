I come from the range. I run patch soaked with #9 through the rifle barrel (Mosin-nagant). It comes out grey. That's expected. I repeat with clean path and it comes out equally dirty. And so on. Do I really need to repeat the process until patch comes out white? What if I just do it couple of times to get really bad residue out? What will be affected if I stop scrubbing at this point and how long will it take to produce noticeable negative effect if any?
