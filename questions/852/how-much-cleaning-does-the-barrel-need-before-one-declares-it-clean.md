## How much cleaning does the barrel need before one declares it clean?

<p>I come from the range. I run patch soaked with #9 through the rifle barrel (Mosin-nagant). It comes out grey. That's expected. I repeat with clean path and it comes out equally dirty. And so on. Do I really need to repeat the process until patch comes out white? What if I just do it couple of times to get really bad residue out? What will be affected if I stop scrubbing at this point and how long will it take to produce noticeable negative effect if any? </p>

<p>There are fundamentally only two reasons to clean a barrel:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To preserve accuracy, which may erode as the barrel gets dirty (very, very dirty for most off-the-shelf rifles).</p></li>
<li><p>To protect and preserve the barrel metal from corrosion, whether from water or corrosive agents left from fired ammo.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As long as your accuracy has not deteriorated and your barrel is not corroding it is clean enough.  You certainly don't have to clean until you can get a white patch through the bore.  A good high-ammonia cleaner (Sweet's 7.62 or Barnes CR-10) will get most everything with a couple of patches (follow with some light oil).</p>
