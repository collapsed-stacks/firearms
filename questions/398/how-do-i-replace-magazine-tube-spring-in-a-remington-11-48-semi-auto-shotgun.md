I have a old Remington shotgun 11-48 I inherited from my grandfather.  The tube spring is all mucked up and instead of the normal capacity, it will only hold 2 rounds.  How can I go about replacing this or getting it replaced?  I'd prefer to replace myself unless it's a crazy task.   It still loads and shoots fine, and three rounds (one in the chamber) is enough for most game but...  

I'm certain it's the spring.  I take the gun mostly apart to clean it, and just have never deciphered how to replace that part (or where to get it).  The spring is clearly tangled.
