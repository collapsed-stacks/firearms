I have a old Remington shotgun 11-48 I inherited from my grandfather.  The tube spring is all mucked up and instead of the normal capacity, it will only hold 2 rounds.  How can I go about replacing this or getting it replaced?  I'd prefer to replace myself unless it's a crazy task.   It still loads and shoots fine, and three rounds (one in the chamber) is enough for most game but...  

I'm certain it's the spring.  I take the gun mostly apart to clean it, and just have never deciphered how to replace that part (or where to get it).  The spring is clearly tangled.

For dis-assembly, there's a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Ev8K8eG0I&feature=related) and [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZLIjfCZ6-U&feature=related)
[Bob's Gun Shop](http://www.gun-parts.com/remingtonshotgun/) claims to have the magazine spring for $10.
For other parts, it looks like a number of parts from the Remington Model 870 are [interchangeable.](http://www.wisnersinc.com/additional_info/remington_1148.htm)

Edit: While the first video show's the magazine spring being removed, I'm not sure that his shotgun is in it's original configuration, and the second does not cover the removal of the spring. If you look [here](http://stevespages.com/pdf/remington_1148.pdf), there is a PDF of the manual that describes removing the magazine spring on page 5. It says:

> Insert blade of screwdriver into hole in spring retainer and pry retainer from magazine tube. Remove retainer slowly to relieve tension of magazine spring. Remove spring and follower.

There's a pretty decent picture of the spring retainer itself [here.](http://www.gunsamerica.com/976941767/Non-Guns/Gun-Parts/Shotgun-High-Grade/Remington_Mdl_11_48_Magazine_Spring_Retainer.htm)

I doubt this is a problem with the spring.  It sounds like you have a duck plug in there.  A duck plug is a wooden or plastic dowel in the magazine tube of a shotgun to limit it to three rounds (two in the magazine, one in the chamber) to comply with waterfowl hunting regulations.  Have you taken the magazine apart and seen what's in there?
