<p>Are there any kind of firearms that can be created/assembled at home and what would be the equipment/skills required?</p>

<p>Edit: for personal use, outside US (but I am more interested in knowing whether it is actually achievable in practice)</p>

<p>On the legal side, according to US Federal law, you can make any kind of Title 1 firearm (fitting NFA definitions for handgun, rifle, or shotgun) for personal use with no Federal licenses required (state laws may vary). The rules get a little fuzzier when it comes to sales - technically, you can sell a gun that you built, but if you are building guns for the purpose of selling them to others, then you need a Type 7 FFL (manufacturing license). The exact line is subject to interpretation by courts and federal agents, so it is generally best to stay as far on the good side as you can.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/general.html#gca-manufacturing">ATF's Website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Does the GCA prohibit anyone from making a handgun, shotgun or rifle? </p>
  
  <p>With certain exceptions a firearm may be made by a non-licensee
  provided it is not for sale and the maker is not prohibited from
  possessing firearms. However, a person is prohibited from assembling a
  non-sporting semi-automatic rifle or non-sporting shotgun from
  imported parts. In addition, the making of an NFA firearm requires a
  tax payment and approval by ATF. An application to make a machine gun
  will not be approved unless documentation is submitted showing that
  the firearm is being made for a Federal or State agency.</p>
  
  <p>[18 U.S.C. 922(o) and (r), 26 U.S.C. 5822, 27 CFR 478.39, 479.62 and
  479.105]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the wrinkles is that a receiver that is less than 80% complete is not considered a firearm, and so can be built, bought, and sold just like any other chunk of metal. The exact definition of what constitutes 80% complete is similarly fuzzy, but there are multiple companies selling &lt; 80% receivers intended to be finished at home (see <a href="http://www.ar15plus.com/default.asp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.colfaxtactical.com/">here</a>).</p>

<p>For Title 2 items (machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, destructive devices (guns with caliber > .50 and anything involving explosives), and Any Other Weapons), things get more complex. They can all be made, but they must be registered first, before construction. This means that you can make you own suppressors, AOWs, short-barreled rifles, and shotguns under the same rules, but you must have a NFA <a href="http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/form1.html">Form 1</a> filed and approved with a tax stamp <strong>before</strong> you start construction. It can be sold to another person only under normal NFA rules (the buyer must have an approved form 4 before they can take possession), and with the same provision that if it looks like you are manufacturing for the purpose of sales, then you need the appropriate manufacturing license.</p>

<p>Making machine guns is a special case, because the BATFE will not register machine guns manufactured after 1986 for civilian possession. To register one, and therefore to legally manufacture one, you must be a FFL/SOT.</p>

<p>Destructive devices are trickier - I don't personally know anyone manufacturing them, and haven't been able to find any solid information about it online. If you intend to manufacture anything involving explosives or large-caliber weapons, it would be best to ask the BATFE directly.</p>

<p>That's the legal side. As for the technical side, it is possible to make almost anything at home, given the right tools and equipment. A quality CNC mill and a lathe will cover a lot of bases, and there are plans and forums online in support of fabricating parts for many popular firearms, including 1911 pistols and AR15 rifles. The exact details of what is required depend on the model of firearm, and going into that much detail on metalworking seems beyond the scope of this site (is there a stackexchange site more associated with advanced metalworking/fabrication?).</p>

<p>Yes.  US federal law allows individuals to manufacture firearms for their personal use (i.e. not for sale - which would require a manufacturing license) as long as the firearm is of a type that would be legal for them to purchase.  </p>

<p>It's a hobby for some and there are numerous websites where builders share their builds, ask questions, and discuss potential builds.  A few examples:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.homegunsmith.com/cgi-bin/ib3/ikonboard.cgi">homegunsmith</a>
<a href="http://garagegunsmithing.com/index.php?option=com_jfusion&amp;Itemid=56">garage gunsmithing</a></p>

<p>Note that some of the participants on these sites are assembling from existing parts, but others are truly manufacturing firearms.</p>

<p>Common firearms to make are AR-15's, which can be manufactured from partially completed receivers ("80% receivers") - these have much of the machining done, but not to the extent that they are yet considered firearms.  An 80% build is usually something that can be completed using a template or jig and in the case of the AR a tap for the buffer tube.  They can also be machined from scratch, or a raw forging by those with even modest machine tools.  AK style rifles are another favorite, with receivers being manufactured by either buying a 'pre-bent' piece of steel and drilling and machining (done successfully with a drill and dremel tool by many) or buying a pre-drilled 'flat' and bending it to shape.</p>

<p>There are many other builds, and the old adage "where there's a will, there's a way" certainly applies.  There are scratch built firearms patterned after no particular other firearm.</p>

<p>I'm sure that any reasonably competent machinist could do it with tools common to the trade (which many in the trade do have at home).  I suspect that the real problem with actually trying to do it would be if it's legal or not in your area.</p>

<p>So, theoretically, pretty much anything would be possible with commonly available tools for someone skilled in the precision metalworking arts.  Practically speaking, I don't see it happening without an additional large investment in a lawyer.  :-)</p>
