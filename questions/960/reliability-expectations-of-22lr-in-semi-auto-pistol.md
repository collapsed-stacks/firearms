I'm new to rimfire cartridges in trying to reduce my target shooting costs
from using 9mm all the time. I picked up a Sig 1911-22 several months ago
and have been less than impressed with the reliability. I take good
care of it and use Ballistol and TW25 to clean and lubricate the firearm.

After about 50 rounds it starts to jam big time. Fails to cycle,
fails to eject, you name it. Recently the guide rod snapped while
firing, locked up so bad I sent it back to Sig to fix it. I couldn't
even take it apart.

I've been shooting mostly Fiocchi and some CCI, jacketed. It was
broken in with HV rounds, yellow jackets, per the sales guy recommendation.

My question is are these levels of reliability normal for this
platform? Is there an ammo type/velocity I should be using to avoid
these problems? I'm ready to give up and trade this in for a 22LR revolver.
Thanks in advance.

Finally received the 1911-22 back from Sig and the guts of the gun have
been replaced. An *upgraded recoil guide rod and barrel bushing*, along with
a ***new barrel***.

It's the last part that bugs me as the gunsmith went on to say that he
discovered "gas cutting" in the chamber which was likely the result of using
.22 cal "short" ammo. This implies that I was shooting the wrong loads which
is completely false. I guess it's impossible that the throat tolerances on
the bore were off to begin with, that would mean QA failed.

We'll take it out to the range soon and see how it does.
