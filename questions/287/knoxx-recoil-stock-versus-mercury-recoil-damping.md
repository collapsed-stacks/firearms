I have a Browning automatic rifle (semi-auto) in 7mm Remington Mag. I know that there is a mercury recoil damper that was made to install in the stock. These have become pretty expensive because of the mercury. I have adapted a Knoxx recoil reducing stock to my Stoeger 2000 and love it (easily half the recoil when shooting 12 gauge slugs). I can't find any data on the percent recoil damping with the mercury accessory and it costs almost as much as the Knoxx stock. Any suggestions? I'm thinking of adapting the Knoxx system to the BAR.
