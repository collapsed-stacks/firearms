<p>I have a Browning automatic rifle (semi-auto) in 7mm Remington Mag. I know that there is a mercury recoil damper that was made to install in the stock. These have become pretty expensive because of the mercury. I have adapted a Knoxx recoil reducing stock to my Stoeger 2000 and love it (easily half the recoil when shooting 12 gauge slugs). I can't find any data on the percent recoil damping with the mercury accessory and it costs almost as much as the Knoxx stock. Any suggestions? I'm thinking of adapting the Knoxx system to the BAR.</p>

<p>I haven't found any metrics either, but I did finally find someone who actually compared dead weight to a mercury suppressor.</p>

  <p>I finally got a chance to sight in my 45/70 since i cut the barrel to 18" I didn't get to use the chrony but will in the spring.I put a 16 Oz mercury suppressor in the stock and yes they work as compared to the 16 oz steel bar i had in the stock . recoil was stout but the rifle was a pleasure to shoot.i will say it jumped up quit a bit but not so bad on the shoulder. I was using buffalo bore factory ammo  435 grain bullets at there advertised velocity of 1925 fps. This load could stop a freight train I was very happy with the suppressor and wanted to share this with you all in case some of you have been thinking about tring one. I was also pleased with the accuracy of the ammo.  Hey Tim i may now be ready to try some of those pile drivers. Later Tanoose</p>
