If there's some sort of visible defect in the outer shell of the casing that would compromise the structural integrity of the shell it's fairly clear to me that you shouldn't fire it.  However, I've had instances where there are minor nicks in the back of the cartridge (but not enough to cause a discharge) or on the actual projectile.  Is there a hard and fast rule for handling misfed ammunition or is it more of a case-by-case basis?
