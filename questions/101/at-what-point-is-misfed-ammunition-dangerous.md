If there's some sort of visible defect in the outer shell of the casing that would compromise the structural integrity of the shell it's fairly clear to me that you shouldn't fire it.  However, I've had instances where there are minor nicks in the back of the cartridge (but not enough to cause a discharge) or on the actual projectile.  Is there a hard and fast rule for handling misfed ammunition or is it more of a case-by-case basis?

If you are using safety as a gauge of what to fire through your firearm, then there is no reason to ever attempt to fire a round of ammunition after it has failed.

I don't think any hard and fast rule would work because of the infinite variability of damage that could occur on a cartridge. 

My rule of thumb is "if in doubt, don't fire it."

Someone else has stated "why risk damaging a rifle over a round that should cost $.30?" That makes a lot of sense to me.
