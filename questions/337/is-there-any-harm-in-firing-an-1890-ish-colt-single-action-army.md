I own a colt single action army made around 1890. The gun is in almost pristine condition. I was given the gun by my grandfather. I know it has not been shot in at least 40 years. How do I tell if it is safe to fire? Secondly, if I were to fire it, where would I find ammunition as I'm not sure what ammunition would be acceptable. The gun is a .44-40, but I don't know if a modern cartridge would have higher pressures than would be acceptable in a gun that old.
