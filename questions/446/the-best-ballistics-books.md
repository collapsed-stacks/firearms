<p>What are some of the best texts on ballistics?  I am specifically interested in advanced topics, but something accessible to beginners belongs on this list too.</p>

<p>I really like <a href="http://appliedballisticsllc.com/index_files/Book.htm" rel="nofollow"><em>Applied Ballistics for Long Range Shooting</em></a> by Bryan Litz.  It's very comprehensive.  In addition to being a long-range competitive shooter the author has a degree in aerospace engineering and you can tell he has a very deep understanding of the subject, but he doesn't let this turn into a physics lecture.  He does a great job explaining these concepts in an understandable way.</p>
