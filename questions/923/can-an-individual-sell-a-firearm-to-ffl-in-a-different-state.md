In the United States, an individual can only buy a firearm in his/her own state. But what about reverse? Can I go to a different state and sell my firearm to a gun shop or someone else with an FFL?

>Can I go to a different state and sell my firearm to a gun shop or someone else with an FFL?

Yes.  Federal law allows for such a transfer.  Though, state laws may be more restrictive.
    
>Q: To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?

>    A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his State, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may sell or transfer a firearm to a licensee in any State. However, a firearm other than a curio or relic may not be transferred interstate to a licensed collector.
