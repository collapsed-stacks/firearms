Excluding round-specific materials, what general supplies/tools should someone have to reload ammunition?

You'll definitely need:

 - Primers of the correct size
 - Gunpoweder
 - a scale (better) or scoop (worse)
 - case lube (optional if you have carbon steel dies)
 - Bullets
 - a press
 - a depriming/sizing die (removes the primer and shapes the brass back to how it should look)
 - an expanding die (expands the mouth of the cartridge to allow the bullet to seat)
 - a bullet seating die
 - a crimping die
 - calipers, for checking Overall Length and other factors
 - A Kinetic Bullet Puller (for removing bullets from brass -- optional) (thanks, @SetiSeeker)

You'll need the appropriate tools to measure the powder (measured scoops or hopper style), clean the used cases if you're not using new brass (brass tumbler and cleaning material), re-size the case and remove the old primer (the dies), install a new one and seat the bullet (the press). If you are reloading a lot, progressive reloaders are probably your best bet as they will cycle through most of the steps with a pull on the lever. If you're going for precision or costs savings, single stage presses are cheaper. I think most of the companies that sell the tools seem to do a decent job reviewing what you'd need as a beginner and there are a number of web sites dedicated to the process.

Trimming hasn't been mentioned yet. Depending on the cartridge and amount of sizing being done, brass can stretch and needs to be trimmed back to spec. I've found this to be the case with .30-06 and .30 Carbine (especially important because it headspaces off the case mouth).

There are a number of trimming options from cheap to super expensive. I went the Lee route with their case gauges and cutter. Brass gets chucked up in a cordless drill with the Lee 3 jaw chuck. After trimming the case mouth gets hit with a quick chamfer and debur. So adding:

 - Some tool for trimming brass to desired length
 - Chamfer/debur tool

In addition to the tools mentioned, you should get at least one good book on reloading.  You want to read the "how to make ammo" parts of it fully, there are many safety and performance tips there to be had.

In addition to Chris' answer, I would add a recipe. A new reloader should not be trying out various loads on their own, they should start with a known recipe for the cartridge of choice, ideally crosschecked with a few different sources.
