<p>I realize that it's impossible to simulate a combat situation. But I think that shooting at  target practice is wildly different from shooting under duress when lives are on the line.</p>

<p>How can someone without military or law enforcement experience practice shooting in a stressful situation so they can be better prepared if the time comes?</p>
