Looking for book suggestions or websites with equations for designing a magazine spring. Also interested in text that discusses the evolution of the magazine spring--why are some rectangular? What are the design considerations that lead to choosing cylindrical vs. rectangular ("magazine")?

<p>I know of nothing addressing magazine springs in particular, but some good spring design references are <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0852429258" rel="nofollow">Designing Springs - Workshop series</a> and the website <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~bazillion/intro.html" rel="nofollow">How to Make Springs</a>.  AGI also offers a good <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/product/145282/american-gunsmithing-institute-agi-video-how-to-make-flat-and-coil-springs-dvd" rel="nofollow">spring-making video</a>, though it's about <em>making</em> rather than <em>designing</em> springs and focuses on springs used in the trigger mechanism, not magazine springs.</p>

<p>There have been a few magazine springs made in threads on <a href="http://www.homegunsmith.com/cgi-bin/ib3/ikonboard.cgi" rel="nofollow">Home Gunsmith</a>, but some may only be available to members.</p>
