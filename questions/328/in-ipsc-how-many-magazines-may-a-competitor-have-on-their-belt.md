In IPSC, how many magazines may a competitor have on their belt?  (open division if that makes a difference).  I've most commonly seen shooters with 2-3 mags on the belt, but I can't find a specific limitation in the ISPC rulebook.

<p>According to the ISPC handgun rulebook available <a href="http://www.ipsc.org/rules/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, long courses must not require more than 32 rounds to complete. I couldn't find any information on the maximum number of rounds a magazine may hold or the maximum number of magazines you can have, so it looks like you can carry as many magazines as you want. Try to have at least 32 rounds on hand, though.</p>

Appendix D1 of the rule book at http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/RulesHandgun.pdf states that open division magazines should be no longer than 170mm but the division has no capacity limit.

There is no limit on the number of magazines you can carry on your belt. However many magazines the shooter would like to with them, it is fine. It is all about strategy - at stages where there is a brief run involved you will see people reload on the run, even if the mag is half empty, there are stages where I have personally went through 3 magazines. It has also been my experience that you generally see 2-3 magazines worn on everyone's belts at a competitions as well, although not always necessary depending on how you run the course.
