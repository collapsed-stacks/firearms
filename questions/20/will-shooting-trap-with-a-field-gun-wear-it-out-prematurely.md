I have read that guns set up for trap and other shooting games can have tens of thousands of rounds run through them before the barrels begin to have issues.  If all I have is my field gun, will I be putting too much wear on it by shooting trap?  Assuming that it does put wear on it is there any way to limit the wear on my field gun while shooting trap?
