I have several 1911-style magazines from Wilson Combat, specifically the 47OXC model (similar to the 47D) You disassemble them by pushing in a little recessed button on the bottom, which allows the base pad to slide off, which then lets the spring come out. 

When putting a few of these back together after cleaning them, I couldn't get the button to re-seat on four of them. The base pad still goes back on, but if I whack the magazine hard, I can get the base pad to slide off a bit. 

I don't remember ever having this trouble before. It happend on several of them in a row, so I figure I must be doing something wrong. What's the trick to do this correctly?
