When immigrating to the US, what is the options to bring with guns/handguns. 

I guess it might depend on the state and so forth. I am selling most my guns since guns are cheaper in the US anyways but a couple of custom long guns which is really nice that I might want to bring with me. 

I guess that it something similar to the Alien Licence mentioned in "[Is it legal for a non-US citizen to purchase a firearm in the United States?][1]" but applying for those seem to require that you are already in the US.

<p>Generally speaking, if you are legal to be in the country, legal to possess firearms and ammunition, the firearms in question are legal in the United States and they are not intended for resale, you can file with the ATF to import firearms.</p>

<p>Depending on the state that you will be immigrating to, there may be other laws governing the possession of firearms by legal aliens. </p>
