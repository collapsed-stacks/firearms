I have a young child in my house, and he's VERY curious. I want to make sure I have good safety procedures so my son wont injure himself with it.

The steps I will be taking is to not keep it loaded, and have a trigger guard and weapon vault.  

What other setups are recommended? I also plan on using my weapons for home defense, so I want ammo and ability to load my weapon easily and fast if I need to protect my home/child.
