I know that the inertial spring and gas recoil systems are different, and that breaking in the new shotgun is important. I've shot high (3 - 3 1/2) Dram equivalent shells to break in my Stoeger 2000 (inertial spring recoil system), but I'm wondering if I can use the lower power shells since the shotgun is broken in (200 rounds)?
