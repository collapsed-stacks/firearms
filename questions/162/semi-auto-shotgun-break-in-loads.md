<p>I know that the inertial spring and gas recoil systems are different, and that breaking in the new shotgun is important. I've shot high (3 - 3 1/2) Dram equivalent shells to break in my Stoeger 2000 (inertial spring recoil system), but I'm wondering if I can use the lower power shells since the shotgun is broken in (200 rounds)?</p>

<p>As I understand the theory, the break-in period for a shotgun is to get recoil system working smoothly with lower power loads vs. a rifle where the theory is to ensure the barrel surface settles and doesn't get permanent build up or something.</p>

<p>With that said, I've never paid attention to break-in periods for shotguns. Since the goal is to have the shotgun cycle lower-power rounds smoothly, you could check yourself if your gun does that after any number of rounds. However, as I understand the intertia system, there's nothing to break in. </p>
