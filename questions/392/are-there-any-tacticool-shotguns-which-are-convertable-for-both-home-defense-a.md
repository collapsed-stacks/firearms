Looking for a convertable shotgun for both home defense and hunting/sporting.

Looking for features such as collapsible stock, pistol grip (possibly removable), rails,
obviously swappable barrels for home vs hunt/sport

pump vs semi likely, as I dont think 2 shot models (coach, over/under) cover defense adequetely
