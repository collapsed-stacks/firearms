Looking for a convertable shotgun for both home defense and hunting/sporting.

Looking for features such as collapsible stock, pistol grip (possibly removable), rails,
obviously swappable barrels for home vs hunt/sport

pump vs semi likely, as I dont think 2 shot models (coach, over/under) cover defense adequetely

Big 5 Sports out here routinely sells the Mossburg 500 in a combo pack that includes the tactical and long barrels and comes with the extended tube installed (a dowel is used to reduce the number of loaded shells for field use). The advantage is that there are many many tactical ad-ons for the Mossy. I tricked mine out with a tri-rail forearm, ATI folding stock with shell holder, front grip with a shotgun-rated laser/tactical flashlight. Was thinking of going with the ghost ring system but am pretty convinced to avoid it after getting advice here.

The Stoeger 2000 semi-auto also has a black combo that has the short and long barrels. But there are almost no bolt-on tactical accessories for it, though they do "sell" a pistol-grip camo stock as a part of their turkey hunting setup. But they are notoriously out-of-stock on individual components, so I don't really recommend it, if you are looking to construct a full tactical setup.

When shooting birds, I just take the front grip off the rail, leave the stock extended and drop in the longer barrel when using the Mossy. The pistol grip makes shooting dove a bit different than with a normal stock. But last time out, I was successful and am getting better the more I shoot with the tactical stock.

<p>I just saw this <a href="http://www.bullpupunlimited.com/order" rel="nofollow">thing</a>. It takes a Remington 870 and turns it into a bullpup shotgun. It's a little ridiculous, but that seems to fit the bill.</p>

The biggest difference between clay sports guns and home defense guns is the barrel length. Shotguns marketed for personal defense tend to have 18.5" barrel while clay sports and field guns have barrel in the range of 28" to 34" in length. There are other difference, like sights vs. a bead, pistol grips, etc. But barrel length is the biggest difference. 

Any home defense shotgun that allows you to change the barrel would work as a clay sports gun or a field gun. If you're looking to just become more comfortable with your home defense gun, I would recommend playing clay sports with as little as possible changed. I've shot trap and sporting clays with an 18.5" iron-sighted barrel and did just fine. Some clubs don't allow barrels shorter than a certain length (often 22") so having the longer barrel is handy. But, if you're looking for practice with your home defense gun, change as little as possible. Folks at the club may chuckle at your tactical gun, ignore them and have fun.

I think just about any of the common pump shotguns will have various "tacticool" add on or replacement parts. I see parts for the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 just about everywhere. Personally, I love my 870 Super, nice, inexpensive, and flexible. Shortened barrel, from Mossberg coincidentally, for leaving about the house, and original stock barrel for busting clays.
