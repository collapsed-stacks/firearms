I own a Schmidt-Rubin 7.5x55 Swiss rifle.

I've seen some very rough descriptions of steps to take to accurize the rifle beyond its factory condition, but am unsure as to which are legit and helpful, vs which are "old wives' tales".

What are the proper steps to take to accurize a Schmidt-Rubin?

In general, _most_ rifles (there are some exceptions where they prefer pressure bedding etc..) benefit from a combination of bedding the action and floating the barrel (or at least minimizing the contact of barrel and stock).
In the case of this specific rifle, you can completely replace the original stock as was done [here](http://www.full-bore.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=2894), eliminating the foregrip. Or as mentioned [here](http://www.swissrifles.com/sr/pierre/accurizing.html), shim the stock in such a way as to bring it out of most contact with the barrel.
