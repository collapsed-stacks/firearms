I'm looking for one company that makes either a [.300 Winchester Magnum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.300_Winchester_Magnum) or [.338 Lapua Magnum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.338_Lapua_Magnum) upper, and [.50 BMG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG) upper for the AR-15 (both should be bolt action, magazine fed). Does anyone make both without being egregiously expensive (over $5k)?
For those wondering, the AR-15 lower requirement is to preserve a common manual of arms.
Purpose for the .338 is learning long range shooting, and would like to retain a consistent feel.
