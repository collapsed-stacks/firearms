Recently, at the range, a friend of mine showed me his Taurus .40 semiauto, a pistol that appeared pretty normal with the exception of one very interesting feature:

When a loaded magazine is inserted on an open slide, the slide will release, chambering the first round.

This seemed to be a very useful feature, since it eliminates the last movement in the reloading process (either fiddling with the slide release or reaching up to the slide with your off hand for the grab-n-tug), which made me wonder why none of the many other high-quality handguns that I've fired feature anything similar.  The only thing I can think of is that there must be some significant disadvantage to this design that I haven't figured out yet.

**What disadvantages are there to a pistol design that automatically releases the slide when a full magazine is inserted?**
