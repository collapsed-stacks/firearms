<p>In a review of the three volume "Pistole Parabellum," American Rifleman stated that the Luger pistol is "arguably the world's most collectible handgun." (Feb 2012 issue, page 32).</p>

<p>I face a practical problem:  I don't know enough about the Luger or the collecting world to understand the above statement.  </p>

<p>Therefore, I seek an answer to the following question:</p>

<p>If you are a collector, would you please tell me what makes the Luger a prized possession?</p>

<p>I believe this question to be answerable without generating opinions.  Sample points for discussion might tell me facts about the supply of such pistols.  Perhaps there are interesting variants that make collecting interesting.  Or, perhaps AR is incorrect and this is not a collectible handgun -- cost data might back up such an assertion.</p>

<p>Perhaps you might even provide me with facts about why the Luger would be more prized than another pistol from the same era.</p>

<p>Several reasons.  First, simply it's historic connections.  WWII, the Nazis, all that.
Secondly, it's as if the Germans set out to make a collectible item.  All manner of variations as to barrel length, caliber, accessories, decoration...The Nazis were very fond of issuing special pistols ( and knives ) to different units, different services, etc.
Plus they're just a well-designed and "sexy" looking firearm.</p>
