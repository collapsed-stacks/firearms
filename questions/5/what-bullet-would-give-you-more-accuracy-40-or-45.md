Would a .40 caliber bullet be more accurate in general than a .45 caliber bullet in a pistol? (Assuming the same gun type).

Generally it's easier to make a larger bullet more accurate...

The rotational acceleration of a larger diameter bullet makes it easier to stabilize, hence more accuracy.

Having said that, there is more than just bullet diameter that affects accuracy.
