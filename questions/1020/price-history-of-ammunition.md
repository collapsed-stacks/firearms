<p>Related to <a href="http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1019/">Pricing comparison for lead vs lead-free ammunition</a>, I also went looking for concrete info about ammunition price trends. We all know it's gone up, and that compounds with the additional cost of steel ammo to slow its adoption.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to find a nice line graph covering a few representative types of ammo from 2004/05 to the present. Anyone have any info like that? I'm not even sure where to find historical pricing data if I was going to compile such a graph myself.</p>

<p>So far this is the best I've been able to find, but it's only through the beginning of 2008:</p>
