Related to [Pricing comparison for lead vs lead-free ammunition](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1019/), I also went looking for concrete info about ammunition price trends. We all know it's gone up, and that compounds with the additional cost of steel ammo to slow its adoption.

I'm hoping to find a nice line graph covering a few representative types of ammo from 2004/05 to the present. Anyone have any info like that? I'm not even sure where to find historical pricing data if I was going to compile such a graph myself.
