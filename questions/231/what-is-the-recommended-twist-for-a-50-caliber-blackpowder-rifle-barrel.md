I am going to manufacture a barrel for a custom black powder rifle and am wondering if there are some suggestions for the best rifling twist to use. It will be a .50 caliber barrel.

Depends on if you plan to use conical bullets and or sabots or patched ball. The conical and saboted rounds tend to benefit more from a faster twist, ball from a slower twist. There is a good article on it on [Blackpowder Journal](http://www.blackpowderjournal.com/archives/vol2no3/articles/BPJ23-5.htm)

The general recommendations seem to be: 

   - 1:60 or slower is a good twist for ball. 
   - 1:48 is a compromise twist, okay for both, but great at neither 
   - 1:32 or faster is a good twist for conical and sabot. At least one custom barrel maker offers a 1:20 twist.
