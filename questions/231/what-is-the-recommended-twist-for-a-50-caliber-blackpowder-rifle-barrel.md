<p>I am going to manufacture a barrel for a custom black powder rifle and am wondering if there are some suggestions for the best rifling twist to use. It will be a .50 caliber barrel.</p>

<p>Depends on if you plan to use conical bullets and or sabots or patched ball. The conical and saboted rounds tend to benefit more from a faster twist, ball from a slower twist. There is a good article on it on <a href="http://www.blackpowderjournal.com/archives/vol2no3/articles/BPJ23-5.htm" rel="nofollow">Blackpowder Journal</a></p>

<p>The general recommendations seem to be: </p>

<ul>
<li>1:60 or slower is a good twist for ball. </li>
<li>1:48 is a compromise twist, okay for both, but great at neither </li>
<li>1:32 or faster is a good twist for conical and sabot. At least one custom barrel maker offers a 1:20 twist.</li>
</ul>
