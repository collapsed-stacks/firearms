If I were to throw a bunch of rounds on the floor hard, or handle them roughly in any other way would they go off? (not that I'm inclined to throwing live rounds around, I'm just curious).

In general, no.  For the round to go off, something sufficiently pointed would have to strike the primer at approximate center.  The bullet end is heavier, making such an event even less likely.  Accidental ignition can occur through very specific mishandling like loading pointed ammunition in a tubular magazine (such that the bullet of one round rests on the primer of the round ahead).  I've dropped bags and boxes of ammo down my shop steps (wood steps, concrete floor) more times than I care to admit without incident.

I don't know if you consider fire "handling roughly", but 5.56 mm rounds _will_ go off if left in a fire.
