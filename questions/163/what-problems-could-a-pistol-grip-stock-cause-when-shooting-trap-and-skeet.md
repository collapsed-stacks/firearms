I installed a Knoxx recoil stock on my Stoeger 2000, that came with both the tactical and field barrels. It has a pistol grip by the trigger. If I want to shoot skeet or trap, will the grip cause a problem?

It will change the way the shotgun naturally points. On a gun for shooting sport that will definately affect your natural aim and tracking.

This can be overcome to some degree with lots of practice, but the easiest way to deal with it would be to put the stock on a non-field gun and keep the standard stock on the field gun, or swap them out based on what you're going to be doing that day. 

As the old saying goes, "Mission dictates gear."
