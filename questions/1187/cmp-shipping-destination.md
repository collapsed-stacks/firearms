I am planning on ordering an M1 Garand from the CMP and had one question. Do they ship the rifle directly to your home or do they ship it to an FFL? I have ordered guns online before and those always have to be shipped to an FFL, but after reading all the documentation on the CMP site it sounds like they ship it right to your home address because they have already done a background check on you. Wondering because I am planning on moving in a month and the CMP ship times are currently around 60 days, so I can't have a rifle showing up at my old address if they do indeed ship directly to the buyers home.
