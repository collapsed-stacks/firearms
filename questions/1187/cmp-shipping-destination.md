I am planning on ordering an M1 Garand from the CMP and had one question. Do they ship the rifle directly to your home or do they ship it to an FFL? I have ordered guns online before and those always have to be shipped to an FFL, but after reading all the documentation on the CMP site it sounds like they ship it right to your home address because they have already done a background check on you. Wondering because I am planning on moving in a month and the CMP ship times are currently around 60 days, so I can't have a rifle showing up at my old address if they do indeed ship directly to the buyers home.

They can ship rifles directly to your house. From [the CMP FAQ](http://www.odcmp.com/Sales/faq.htm):

<blockquote>
we are not your regular gun dealer. The law that established the CMP exempted us from FFL requirements. We are not required to keep a 'book' or to ship only to another FFL. The law also specifies that we must have a completed 'successful' background check conducted for each sale. So - we cannot ship a rifle until we get a 'proceed' from the FBI. The three days after a 'delay' does not apply to us as it does to FFL licensed dealers. <b>We can also ship direct to your home, where dealers cannot.</b></blockquote>
