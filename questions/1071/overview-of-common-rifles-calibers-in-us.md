I'm kind of lost looking at all the different calibers available. Can someone list the common rifle calibers in an order like least powerful to most powerful, or grouped by application, or whatever makes sense? I don't even know enough about them to know what a sensible way to compare them would be, so some sort of overview of the options would be very helpful.
