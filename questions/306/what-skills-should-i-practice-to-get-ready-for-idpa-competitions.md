<p>I've been shooting pistol for years but have been doing it recreationally and I would like to start competing in events like the IDPA.  What skills should I focus on to bring my skill up to a tactical level?</p>

<p>The primary skills that IDPA competition is going to test are drawing the pistol, shooting at targets in the 5-15 yard range, and reloads.  On some stages there's also a bit of weak hand shooting and shooting while moving.  One thing you might do is take a look at the <a href="http://www.idpa.com/classify1.asp" rel="nofollow">IDPA Classifier</a> (the course of fire they use to separate shooters into different skill categories), since it's designed to be fairly representative of the shooting skills IDPA uses.</p>

<p>However, the best way to learn what you need to do to shoot IDPA is to shoot an IDPA match.  I've found that they're very accepting of new shooters.  Get out to a local IDPA match and shoot it.  I'm sure more experienced shooters will be willing to offer feedback and it will probably be pretty obvious what you need to work on.</p>

<p>Key elements to practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing and acquiring a target (which most ranges won't allow, but you can practice at home USING SNAP-CAPS)</li>
<li>Rapidly moving from target to target (practice using something like the <a href="http://pistol-training.com/drills/dot-torture" rel="nofollow">Dot Torture drill</a>)</li>
<li>Rapid follow-up shots (assuming your range allows things like that)</li>
<li>Reloading (easy enough to practice at the range)</li>
</ul>

<p>@Chris Upchurch is right in saying that the best practice is actual competition, but practicing the above skills at the range will translate into improved performance in competition.</p>

<p>I'd start out by checking out the IDPA clubs in your area and seeing exactly how they run their matches. I've been to several different clubs, and they tend to emphasize different things. It's perfectly fine to just go to the match and shoot it - just talk to them ahead of time to make sure you bring the right equipment.</p>

<p>Your general skills are drawing and getting on target fast, from a competition or concealment holster, firing at the target rapidly and accurately, moving to new targets, and reloading rapidly. Most also test some combination of moving while shooting, shooting from behind cover, reloading with proper use of cover, distinguishing no-shoots under stress, and one-handed shooting and reloading.</p>

<p>I've found practicing with a semi-auto Airsoft pistol at home to be very helpful, especially if you get one that matches the gun you are competing with and use your competition holster.</p>

<p>Also remember that anytime you reload in IDPA and your weapon is not in slide lock you must retain the magazine. This includes when you have a round in the chamber but the magazine is empty. This is one of the areas I have to work on and remember because I shoot both IDPA and IPSC.</p>

<p>There are multiple competitive shooting organizations which all focus on different things.</p>

<p>IDPA focus' on defensive shooting, you always need to shoot behind cover, reload behind cover, don't drop any magazines if they aren't empty etc. If you violate any of those rules you are deducted points. (http://idpa.com/)</p>

<p>USPSA is more of your run and gun courses, not really any rules which I prefer much more over IDPA. The USPSA flavor is where you will see some race guns which makes for a really fun event. (http://uspsa.com/)</p>

<p>NRA Action is a set course, ie the course of fire never changes, unlike IDPA and USPSA where you will never shoot the same course again. NRA Action is more of the marksmanship challenge with time constraints. THey will give you a timer and let you shoot x rounds in y seconds, if you shoot after your time is up you will be deducted a bullseye from your target. You will also shoot the same string of target multiple times moving back from the targets about 5 yards from your previous string. (http://www.nrahq.org/compete/dept-action.asp)</p>

<p>I have personally shot in all three different types of competitive shooting and prefer USPSA to get your blood pumping. NRA Action will make you a much better shot and will help get your shooting cadence in check to utilize all the time you have available. Finally, I didn't really enjoy the IDPA matches that I went to because there were too many rules, compared to when you are coming from a USPSA background.</p>
