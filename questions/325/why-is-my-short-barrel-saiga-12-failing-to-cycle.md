So I have a registered SBS (Short Barreled Shotgun) Saiga-12 that I was attempting to fire for the first time the other day and it would repeatedly fail to cycle.  I tried multiple different types of shells (low-brass birdshot, high-brass birdshot, buckshot) with the gas system opened to both the '1' (partial open) and '2' (full open) position.  In almost every case, the shell contained would eject but a new shell would not be fed into the chamber.  On occasion, the ejected shell would be caught halfway out by the bolt returning forward.  Occasionally it would cycle correctly.

Does anyone have any idea as to what might be causing this and things I could do to fix it?
