Is it possible to add some sort of magazine extension to a Mossberg 500 shotgun? Would it make takedown or barrel changes more complicated?

Because of the design of the Mossberg 500 (*the barrel lug attaches to the end of the magazine tube.*) You are fairly limited in your tube extension options. One option requires you to replace the barrel as well as the tube. Brownells sells a [kit](http://www.brownells.com/.aspx/pid=25124/Product/MOSSBERG-500-HIGH-CAPACITY-SHOTGUN-KIT) (*Out of stock at the time of this post*) that will increase the capacity to 8. You can also try to find the [Knoxx Sidewinder](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/984689/knoxx-sidewinder-shotgun-conversion-kit-with-10-round-drum-magazine-maverick-88-mossberg-500-590-590a1-composite-and-steel-black) conversion kit. I'm not sure if they're still made and look to be fairly expensive. There are also some other one off options I've seen mentioned, such as a custom machined piece of gear as well as possibly swapping the barrel and tube with another Mossberg model (*not sure of the details*).
