I've recently purchased a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x44 scope.  The objective lens, being 44mm, is one of the larger ones out there.  What's the exact purpose of a larger objective?  I was told it allows more light to enter, providing a brighter image.  Is there another purpose in addition to that?

In addition, what purpose does the larger tube serve?  Mine has a 30mm tube vs. the other popular 25.4mm tubes.  Do I gain any advantage with the larger tube?

I've seen many conflicting descriptions on both of these parts of the scope, yet never seen any kind of answer that was definitive.
