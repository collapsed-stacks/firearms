Extremely simple. Clear the weapon, move the pump back about 1/2 way and unscrew the cap from the end of the magazine tube. Grab the barrel and pull it forward, it will come right off. Reverse the process to install a new barrel. There are a large variety of barrels you can replace the original with, shortened, rifled etc.. A Google search for the shotgun model and barrel type you're interested in should bring up a number of sources.
