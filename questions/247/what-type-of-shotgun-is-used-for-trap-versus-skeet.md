<p>Do you need a different shotgun setup for each? What choke is recommended for each?</p>

<p>The main difference between trap and skeet guns are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>trap guns are setup to shoot high vs. skeet guns shooting flat (however some people like to shoot skeet with a trap gun because they like to float the target)</li>
<li>in skeet you shoot the targets at the same distance all the time, therefore the chokes are sometimes fixed for that distance vs. trap being hit at varying distances</li>
<li>skeet guns are also shorter for faster swinging, but this is mostly preference</li>
</ul>
