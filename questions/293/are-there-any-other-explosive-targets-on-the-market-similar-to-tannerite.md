I've had some fun shooting tannerite targets this summer.  I picked up a case at a gun show and was very pleased with the effectiveness of knowing my target was hit from a distance.  I've heard that there are other targets on the market that report hits in similar exciting fashion.  Can anyone enlighten.  Hopefully it goes without saying that I am only interested in those that are legally purchased.  I'm not looking to make my own.
