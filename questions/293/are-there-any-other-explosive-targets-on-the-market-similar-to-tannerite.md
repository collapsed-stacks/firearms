<p>I've had some fun shooting tannerite targets this summer.  I picked up a case at a gun show and was very pleased with the effectiveness of knowing my target was hit from a distance.  I've heard that there are other targets on the market that report hits in similar exciting fashion.  Can anyone enlighten.  Hopefully it goes without saying that I am only interested in those that are legally purchased.  I'm not looking to make my own.</p>

<p>Star makes an explosive "target" that is comparable to tannerite. Here is a link:
<a href="http://www.startargets.com/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.startargets.com/en/</a></p>

<p>I've made homemade tannerite and I think that the Star targetes have a greater "boom" for the ounce. I've shot old prescription vials that had the star binary mixture in them and the explosion was significantly bigger that the same amount of tannerite.</p>

<p>In both cases, the compounds are legal to ship, store and transport as long as the two components of each are not mixed. Once they are mixed, federal laws kick in and you cannot legally transport or store them.</p>

<p>Essentially, they are both takeoffs of thermite, a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum powder, that is used to weld steel. Any oxidizing agent can make the aluminum burn quickly, the requirement for an explosion.</p>

<p>Another kick is to shoot coleman propane cylinders with tracer rounds. You get the same effect. I buy 9mm tracers when the gunshow comes around and they really work (can't remember that name of the ammo company that sells them, they are a bit pricey - about $2 per round). BTW, simply shooting into a propane container with a normal round will not make it explode (there was a MythBusters episode that tested this). If you do this, you do want to be at least 25 yds away, as there is the possibility of metal fragments flying.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the ammo:

<p>Red Jacket Firearms (famous for the Sons of Guns TV show) in Louisiana also sells a similar binary explosive for use as a reactive target.</p>
