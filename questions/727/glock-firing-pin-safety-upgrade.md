When shopping for used Glocks, how can I tell if a pistol was eligible for the '92 firing pin upgrade? How can I tell whether the upgrade has been performed already?

From [Moto](http://www.flarms.com/forums/showthread.php?113-Glock-Serial-Numbers) on FLArms

The upgraded firing pin safety system consists of: the firing pin, firing pin safety, the extractor, the spring loaded bearing and the trigger bar. The upgraded system is applicable only to Glock pistols with the following serial number ranges :

* Glock 17 - alpha prefixes AA - WF
* Glock 19 - alpha prefixes through WJ
* Glock 20 - alpha prefixes through WW
* Glock 21 - alpha prefixes through XL
* Glock 22 - alpha prefixes through YA
* Glock 23 - alpha prefixes through SK

And from [GlockFAQ](http://www.glockfaq.com) via [J.D. Locke](http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-755.html) on "The High Road"

* Inspect the frame internal parts (trigger assembly, connector, locking block, etc.). Some early pistols need to be upgraded -- the metal internal components of which typically have a black finish as opposed to the current silver finish. Look under the slide at the bottom of the firing pin lug and firing pin safety; look at the trigger bar inside the frame. If these parts are black in color, the pistol needs an upgrade kit. If the parts are dull or shiny silver, it should be fine. Another way to tell if the pistol was made before the update is that the frame serial number plate will be black as opposed to silver, which is the current configuration. If you buy a pistol that needs upgrading, you can take it to a Glock armorer or send it to the Glock Warranty Department where they will perform all the necessary upgrades at no charge.
