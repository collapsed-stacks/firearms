<p>I know the old methods to introduce carbon while hardening the frizzen on a flint lock. Any gunsmiths know of a more modern way to get more carbon introduced into the steel more effectively? I'm not looking for wikipedia links, would like some method based on actual use on frizzens.</p>

<p>The modern approach is to use a formulation like Kasenit:  <a href="http://www.dixiegunworks.com/product_info.php?products_id=6465" rel="nofollow">http://www.dixiegunworks.com/product_info.php?products_id=6465</a></p>
