<p>Looking to replace the recoil spring.  My gut is that the Kimber Full size is an 18# but checking to make sure that is correct.</p>

<p>While not exactly the same, the Custom II's list a 16# spring. You may have to contact Kimber directly to confirm, or check Wilson Combat and see if they can match it up for you.</p>
