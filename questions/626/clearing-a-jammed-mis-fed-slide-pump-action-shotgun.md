What is the best way of clearing a mis-fed shell in a slide (aka pump) action shotgun?

For example, if the slide is *not* racked solidly (ie, you try to 'baby' it), a round may only partially come out of the tube magazine and not engage into the loading ramp to be pushed into the chamber.

Excluding taking the piece apart, what is the best way to clear this type of jam?

If I recall correctly on my Remington 870, the fore-end is does not lock forward unless the bolt is all the way forward. If you move the fore-end a tiny bit backward and flip the gun upside down, the shell should fall out of the ejection port. If you quickly rack the fore-end all the way back and then all the way forward, it should feed a new shell properly.

I'm not a shotgun user but I've always been taught that re-racking the weapon will remove the shell.
