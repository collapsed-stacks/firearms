What is the best way of clearing a mis-fed shell in a slide (aka pump) action shotgun?

For example, if the slide is *not* racked solidly (ie, you try to 'baby' it), a round may only partially come out of the tube magazine and not engage into the loading ramp to be pushed into the chamber.

Excluding taking the piece apart, what is the best way to clear this type of jam?
