I'm referring specifically to a pistol "stored" for home defense. In this scenario, storing the weapon unloaded is not an option since having to load the weapon is undesirable in an emergency situation.

I have kept a Glock 27 loaded for several months without use, but encountered jamming problems when taking it to the range. Presumably the prolonged compression of the magazine spring weakened it, causing improper feeding. The problem self-corrected after about 50 rounds, but jams were frequent during the first 20 rounds.

Unfortunately, going to the range to fire the weapon does not occur as often as I would like. Thus I have to periodically manually unload the magazine, wait a period of time (usually while I field strip and clean the pistol), and reload it.

How often should this be done? How long should the magazine stay unloaded when this is done?
