Non-US citizens can purchase guns in many states. According to FEDERAL law, you can buy a gun as long as you are here legally and have documentation showing as such - you just can't take it outside the country (or violate any specific state laws). State laws may differ case by case, but from a federal standpoint and in absence of more specific state laws, it's legal for people who hold something like a green card to buy and/or possess a firearm. The language about this on the purchasing paperwork can be confusing, but the ATF has clarified it before. To simplify it down, basically: Tourist visa: no you can't buy a gun. Permanent resident: yes, you can buy a gun in compliance with any state and municipal laws.

In order for a non-US Citizen to own a gun, you need to obtain an Aliens Firearms License. With that you can purchase firearms through FFL dealers just as normal, but the background check through NICS will always be delayed. 

With an Aliens Firearms license, you can then obtain (depending on your state) a Concealed Carry Weapons permit as per normal restrictions and requirements.

My wife just took her citizenship exam and will be sworn in next week.   Several years ago right after she got her Green Card we decided to buy my Brother a Henry rifle for Christmas.  We went to the local Gander Mountain and selected the rifle and started the paper work.   I had forgotten to bring my drivers license so she filled it all out and with in 15 minutes we were walking out with our Henry.  This is an example of a non-US Citizen buying a gun because the US Citizen wasn't allowed.

On a side note there shouldn't be any issue with a non-US Citizen getting a concealed carry license, at least here in Ohio.

Under federal law, if you are a legal permanent resident you can purchase a firearm in the United States.  Someone who is here on a tourist visa cannot.  Some states impose additional restrictions.

Yes, as long as you're here legally. It might be more of a hassle.
