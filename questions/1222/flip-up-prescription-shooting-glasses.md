I'm sure everyone here has perfect vision, but in case you don't and struggle with fitting safety glasses over your RX lenses...

I'm looking for a better solution than the "two set" one I have now and am considering "flip ups". This way I would still have the flexibility of wearing the basic frame outside of the range, be able to change the tint, and just be able to "flip down and go" when I enter the range area.

So minimum requirements would be ANSI Z87 or better.

Here's an example of a [sport flip-ups][1] that support prescription lenses, no ANSI though. Any personal experience here or arguments to the contrary? Thanks.

<p>I wear prescription glasses and just fire with them. One guy I know puts impact-resistant glasses over his prescription glasses, he uses the same type of impact-resistant glasses as one would use while drilling.</p>

<p>I personally think that the use of special protection glasses while shooting is foolish. One is generally shooting for one of three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>To familiarize himself with the weapon and to zero it.</li>
<li>To perform an aggression (such as an arrest).</li>
<li>To perform a defense.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously the most critical of these reasons is the third, and in that scenario you will be lucky to have the time to properly place your ear protection on, much less eye protection. So get used to the conditions under which your will be shooting under the third reason, even when you are shooting for one of the other two.</p>

<p>And <em>always</em> wear ear protection.</p>
