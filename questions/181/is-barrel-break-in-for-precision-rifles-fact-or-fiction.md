    As a barrel maker I have looked in thousands of new and used barrels
    with a bore scope and I will tell you that if every one followed the
    prescribed break in method A very large number would do more harm than
    help.  The reason you hear of the help in accuracy is because if you
    chamber barrel with a reamer that has a dull throater instead of cutting
    clean sharp rifling it smears a burr up on the down wind side of the
    rifling.  It takes from 1 to 2 hundred rounds to burn this bur out and
    the rifle to settle down and shoot its best.  Any one who chambers rifle
    barrels has tolerances on how dull to let the reamer get and factories
    let them go longer than any competent smithe would.  Another tidbit to
    consider, Take a 300Win Mag. that has a life expectancy of 1000 rounds. 
    Use 10% of it up with your break in procedure for ever 10 barrels the
    barrel maker makes he has to make one more just to take care of the
    break in. no wonder barrel makers like to see this.  Now when you flame
    me on this please include what you think is happening to the inside of
    your barrel during the break in that is helping you.

And yet on the websites of various other barrel makers, we find long and elaborate procedures for breaking in barrels, claiming to have the benefit of easier cleaning, greater accuracy, and improved barrel life. From barrel maker <a href="">Lilja Precision</a>:

And again from Krieger Barrels we have <a href="http://www.kriegerbarrels.com/Break_In__Cleaning-c1246-wp2558.htm">a third story</a> regarding not the bore, but the throat (left as an exercise for the reader).

So what's the answer to the question of barrel break-in? Is it true, or false? Wisdom for the ages, or merely a common myth perpetuated by superstition-run-rampant?
