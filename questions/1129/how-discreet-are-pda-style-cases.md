How discreet are the PDA-style cases like below?  I personally would recognize it as likely holding a gun, but what are people's experiences with the general public "freak out factor?"  The reason I ask is I have been carrying a buck xtract knife (3" blade) on my belt forever.  I thought it was obviously a knife case, the top half inch is even visible under the flap, but a colleague was surprised when I pulled it out one day.  What have been your experiences with people recognizing it?

The PDA cases won't raise anyone's eyebrows, because they look so very un-gun-like. The downside is that your draw will be slower.
