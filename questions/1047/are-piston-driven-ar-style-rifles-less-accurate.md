## Are Piston-Driven AR Style Rifles Less Accurate?

I have read a few articles about the disadvantages of a piston-cycled design in an AR-15 style rifle. It seems like one of the main complaints about piston systems is that the added mechanics interfere with the barrel setup of the traditional AR design in a way that makes these piston guns less accurate.

Is there strong evidence or data on this, and is the difference in accuracy significant? It seems questionable to me to say one design is always going to be more accurate.
