The frames of Glock pistols in 9mm, .40S&W, .357SIG, and .45GAP are identical except for the ejector.  I know people who shoot 9mm using a .40 frame with either a conversion barrel, or a full 9mm slide.  According to them, the pistol is reliable enough for range use even without changing the ejector, making it easy to switch back and forth between calibers.  Is the opposite true?  Could I take a 9mm frame, put a .40 slide on it and use it to shoot .40 S&W?
