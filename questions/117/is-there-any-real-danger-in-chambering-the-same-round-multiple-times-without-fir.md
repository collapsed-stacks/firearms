The scenario where this happens most is when I have to unload a firearm to take it to the range. It is generally loaded and chambered when at home, and when I re-load the firearm, sometimes the round that was previously chambered will end up being chambered again.

I have heard criticism of this practice, and would like to hear solid information as to the real concern here.
