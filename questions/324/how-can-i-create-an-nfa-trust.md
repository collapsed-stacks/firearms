I once saw a really good guide for creating an NFA trust[1], but I can't find it any more. Does anyone have any guidance on how to do this?


[1]Essentially a virtual legal entity which would "own" NFA Title II items (e.g. suppressors, SBRs, etc), but still allow me full use of them. It makes completing the ATF Form 4 that much easier.

<p>I suggest using a lawyer that specializes in NFA trusts. Yes, this is more expensive than doing it yourself, but you only have to do it once, and compared to the costs of most Title II items and the transfer fees, it isn't that much. The real advantage is that if there is a question about the validity of your trust (like <a href="http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/2009/05/batfe-seeks-to-seize-nfa-firea.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>), then you have an experienced lawyer to back you up, which is a very good thing when they start talking about felony charges, decade prison terms, and 6-figure fines.</p>

I have found several articles on doing it yourself. 
This [one](http://www.northwestfirearms.com/nfa-weapons/26116-how-set-up-trust-nfa.html) seemed to be pretty decent, but then I found this [one](http://arizonagunlist.com/How_to_buy_NFA_class3_weapons_with_a_revocable_living_trust_without_a_CLEO_signoff.html)
and the article on the ATF going after some of the "Quicken Will" based trusts and I'd say, get a lawyer to set it up or at least to review what you set up. The guys at [guntrustlawyer](http://www.guntrustlawyer.com/contact.html) claim to cover a number of states.
