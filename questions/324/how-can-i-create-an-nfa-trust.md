I once saw a really good guide for creating an NFA trust[1], but I can't find it any more. Does anyone have any guidance on how to do this?


[1]Essentially a virtual legal entity which would "own" NFA Title II items (e.g. suppressors, SBRs, etc), but still allow me full use of them. It makes completing the ATF Form 4 that much easier.
