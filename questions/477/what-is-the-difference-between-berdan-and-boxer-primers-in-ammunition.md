<p>The rifles I own will fire both types of ammunition, but I have been unable to determine what the real differences are between the two types.</p>

<p>What are the differences between them, and the pros/cons of each?</p>

<p>Simple answer: Boxer primers are easier to reload.</p>

<p>Complex answer: When the firing pin strikes the primer, the charge is pressed against the anvil, it explodes, and the flash then moves through the flash hole in the base of the cartridge to ignite the powder. Boxer primers have the anvil built in to the primer's body, and as such only need one big flash hole. They're easier to remove, and the cartridge is easier to reload. Berdan primers, on the other hand, don't have an integral anvil. The anvil is built into the cartridge case, and there are two smaller flash holes on either side of the anvil. It's harder to pop the old primer out, and harder to reload.</p>

<p>This is a Bredan-primed cartridge. You can see the anvil built into the brass, and the two flash holes.</p>

<p>And this (below) is a Boxer-primed cartridge. The anvil is integral to the primer.</p>

<p>A subtlety applicable to 1000 yard ammo:</p>

<p>Berdan primers allow for a greater volume of priming compound, also their flash holes are smaller than a Boxer primed case.  This allows for a smaller but longer duration flame, which can make for more uniform ignition and hence better long range accuracy.</p>
