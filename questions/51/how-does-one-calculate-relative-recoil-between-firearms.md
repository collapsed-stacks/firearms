## How does one calculate relative recoil between firearms?

Is there a somewhat simple process for shooters to compare the relative recoil between two pistols?

Assuming we know the caliber/load/firearm how can I understand in human terms what the difference will be in recoil?

For example, shooting 158gr loads in a .357 Magnum 12oz Scandium J-Frame is somewhat aggressive to me.  Can I tell from that what shooting a .44 Magnum 45oz N-Frame would feel like?

How do we factor in the difference between recoil and muzzle flip?  

I'm looking for a technical answer because people generally perceive recoil differently.

Obviously there exist charts that show recoil energy and velocity, but that doesn't take in to account the actual pistol design.
