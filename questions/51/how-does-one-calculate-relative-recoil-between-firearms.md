## How does one calculate relative recoil between firearms?

Is there a somewhat simple process for shooters to compare the relative recoil between two pistols?

Assuming we know the caliber/load/firearm how can I understand in human terms what the difference will be in recoil?

For example, shooting 158gr loads in a .357 Magnum 12oz Scandium J-Frame is somewhat aggressive to me.  Can I tell from that what shooting a .44 Magnum 45oz N-Frame would feel like?

How do we factor in the difference between recoil and muzzle flip?  

I'm looking for a technical answer because people generally perceive recoil differently.

Obviously there exist charts that show recoil energy and velocity, but that doesn't take in to account the actual pistol design.

You can calculate mathematically the recoil difference between two loads, but comparing recoil between firearms can really only be done subjectively because of the large number of factors which are difficult to quantify. Distance between the barrel axis and the hand and the weight and center of gravity of the firearm are factors. On a revolver, the grip type and style are also factors, and on semi-autos, the action design is also a factor. Even the way the gun is gripped can be a factor. If there are any muzzle breaks or compensators, that changes things as well.

For practical purposes, the only way to tell is to shoot them both, or ask people who have shot them both.
