I'm fairly thorough about cleaning my firearms, but I haven't ever cleaned my magazines.  I remember the original documentation for my XD stating that the magazines should be cleaned, but I've fired a couple thousand rounds without any problems.  What problems can occur because of a dirty magazine and how often should I clean to avoid them?
