I have noticed that nearly all modern double barrel shotguns are over-unders and not side-by-sides? Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages to each? I assume it has to do with something specific to the various clay target games.

A side by side shotgun will always have the inherent issue of having two different points of aim. Over-unders mostly eliminate this when shooting skeet and are more popular because of this.
