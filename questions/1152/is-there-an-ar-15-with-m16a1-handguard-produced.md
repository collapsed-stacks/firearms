As the title says - is there still an AR-15 produced with a handguard in M16A1 style?  
Or is it available as an accessory to install on the modern AR-15s? Would it fit on th modern rifles?

(I'm not a big fan of the modern "_tacticool_" railed handguards)

Yeah, they're out there. Try searching for "AR-15A1". [Century](http://www.centuryarms.biz/proddetail.asp?prod=RI1619CA-X) makes at least one version.

Or you can buy original ([used](http://www.gunthings.com/ar15.htm)) M16A1 handguards for $5-35 depending on condition, or $50-75 for new ones. (Try searching for "triangular handguard" if "M16A1 handguard" doesn't work.

As for fit, I haven't been able to find dimensions on the handguards themselves. Best I can do is that the M16A1s had 20" barrels with 19.7" sight radius. Since the front sights aren't mounted at the end of the barrel, shorter-barreled rifles may maintain the same sight radius and same amount of room for the handguard.

If I understand what you're asking, then yes. I googled: `M16A1 handguard AR15` and got several hits from places that look like they are selling complete rifles or kits.
