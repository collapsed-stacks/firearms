I've got '70s era Colt Detective Special in .38 Special from my grandfather. It's in good shape and shoots well. After the a range trip, I do a simple, no-disassembly-required cleaning. This is just scrubbing out the short barrel and each of the chambers, wiping off all the surfaces I can get to with some cleaner, then lubricating everywhere I notice metal-on-metal wear. 

Should be doing any sort of detail strip and maintenance at least once just as a general checkup? With a semi-auto pistol, I typically do one detail strip to be sure I get grease where I want it. Revolvers are a bit like magic to me, I have little understanding of the various internal parts. Any advice is appreciated.
