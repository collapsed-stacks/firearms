We're all familiar with inside-the-waistband, ankle, and shoulder holsters (thank you, Hollywood). What other common (or uncommon) options are available for the concealed carry of a pistol/firearm? Please note if any of them are of questionable legality...

<p>A pocket holster can be discreet and convenient with "pocket pistols", like the <a href="http://seecamp.com/photos.htm" rel="nofollow">.32 Seecamp</a>.</p>

<p>If carrying in this configuration, keep in mind that the firearm will be exposed to plenty of perspiration and pocket lint. Inspect the pistol frequently for lint and corrosion, and clean more often than usual. Also, best to not keep anything else in the pocket that is carrying--make it the "weapon pocket" (don't carry keys, knives, change, etc, in the same pocket). Additionally, often take the pistol to a range and squeeze off the rounds that have been carried in this configuration, or at least swap out the rounds with fresh ones on a relatively frequent basis, especially if you are carrying in a hot and or humid climate.</p>

<p>Finally, use common sense with a pocket holster--don't use it with tight clothing (like jeans),or with something flimsy (like nylon shorts) that would easily reveal the silhouette of the weapon. The pocket should be deep and strong enough to accommodate the holster.</p>

There are probably as many ways to carry and conceal a firearm as there are firearms. There are a variety of "bag" type holsters. There are the "fanny pack" style bags, and for women, there are specially designed purses, there are also messenger bags, briefcases etc.. There are also elasticized "belly bands" that seem to be similar to an ace bandage to go under a shirt, specially designed bras. I can't think of any legal issues with most of them. I guess that might vary by state.

I'll add there's also OWB (outside-waist-band) holster like copss, pocket holsters for 380s and the like, there are "tactical pants" holsters which have a hidden holster underneath the front pockets (I forget the company that makes these), and there necklace/pendant holsters (for really really small guns), etc,

Similar to what @OldWolf said, chances are, if you can think of a way to carry, that someone already has a product to do that.

I use a Blackhawk SERPA paddle holster for my 1911. Even a t-shirt will almost completely it.

Granted, this is not "deep" concealment, but it's well beyond obviously visible to a casual observer.

Probably the most common carry method is OWB, strong side hip.  It's the fastest, generally the most comfortable, and normally fairly concealable.
