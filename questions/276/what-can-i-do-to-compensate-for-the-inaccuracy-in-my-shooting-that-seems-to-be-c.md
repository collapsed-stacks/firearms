## What can I do to compensate for the inaccuracy in my shooting that seems to be caused by a lighter handgun?

I've noticed that I seem to be less accurate with Glock-made pistols (with a plastic frame) than, say, a Sig model (with a metal frame and considerably more heft).  In my mind, the weight seems to make a difference offering more resistance to the recoil especially at a larger caliber.  Is this in my head? If not, I imagine it's my stance/grip that is flawed and are there specific techniques for dealing with lighter-weight handguns outside of just fixing my grip/stance all together?

**Edit** To address @Chris's answer, I realize that a gun with less heft (mass) will result in greater acceleration. The thrust of my question (and my fault for not making this clear) is what can I do to compensate for this?
