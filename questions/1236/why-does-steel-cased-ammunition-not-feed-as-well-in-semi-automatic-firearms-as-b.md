## Why does steel-cased ammunition not feed as well in semi-automatic firearms as brass does?

Many "surplus ammo" offerings are steel-cased. In some of the bolt-action rifles I have (such as the Mossin-Nagant), the ammunition shoots fine.

However, in others (such as my AR-15 or XD), steel-cased ammunition routinely does not eject properly, or does not feed correctly, causing the weapon to jam.

Anecdotally, I have heard this happening with friends as well.

What causes the steel-cased rounds to not feed/eject as well as their brass-cased brethren?
