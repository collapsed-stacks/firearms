## Why does steel-cased ammunition not feed as well in semi-automatic firearms as brass does?

<p>Many "surplus ammo" offerings are steel-cased. In some of the bolt-action rifles I have (such as the Mossin-Nagant), the ammunition shoots fine.</p>

<p>However, in others (such as my AR-15 or XD), steel-cased ammunition routinely does not eject properly, or does not feed correctly, causing the weapon to jam.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I have heard this happening with friends as well.</p>

<p>What causes the steel-cased rounds to not feed/eject as well as their brass-cased brethren?</p>

<p>Brass has a lower friction coefficient. That is, it is a generally a slicker material than the steel used in cartridge cases. This extra friction requires a bit more force to overcome. With some semi-auto firearms (or when some firearms are dirty) the small extra force required can cause misfeeds or ejection problems.</p>
