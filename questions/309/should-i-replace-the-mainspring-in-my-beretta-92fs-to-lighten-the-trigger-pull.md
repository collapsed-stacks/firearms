I'm considering replacing the mainspring in my Beretta 92FS to lighten the trigger pull. To my relatively inexperienced hands, the DA trigger pull on this gun feels quite stiff. My friend, who has a _lot_ more experience with firearms than I do, considers it to be remarkably stiff.

Some research on this issue leads me to believe that this problem is often solved by replacing the stock mainspring with the so-called "D" spring (the mainspring from a DAO variant of the Beretta 92).

At this point, I'm not interested in participating in competitions and I don't want to compromise the reliability of the gun. I _would_ like to make the gun more comfortable to shoot and I suspect the force required to operate the gun makes it harder to be accurate.

Given these concerns, does it make sense for me to replace the mainspring in the gun?

Not sure if you've made the D spring swap yet or not.
I have a 92FS that I've put a few thousand rounds through already. Although mine is pretty well "broken-in" and I love the crisp SA trigger, I've always had issues with the stiff DA trigger pull.

A couple months ago, I finally swapped the stock hammer spring for the D spring and have no regrets. The D spring cost less than $8 and took me about 10 minutes to perform the swap. I've put about 500 rounds (practice ammo only) through it without a single problem.

The DA pull is noticeably (but not a whole lot--couple pounds maybe?) lighter compared to my "broken-in" stock spring. So compared to your fairly new spring, the difference may be even greater. It may just be in my mind, but the SA trigger pull "seems" a hair lighter as well--although I have no proof of this.

I would prefer an even lighter DA/SA trigger pull, but switching to the even lighter competition spring might cause reliability issues that I'm not willing to deal with.

There's always some chance that a lighter spring will reduce the reliability.  For your particular gun and that specific spring, I don't know if it's a significant concern or not, but I'd suspect it's probably not.  

That said, that wouldn't be my first resort.  I'd buy some snap caps, and spend a good bit of time dry-firing it to see if that, along with regular range trips helped me to become more comfortable with the pull, or perhaps to break it in a bit as @Bryson mentioned in the comments.

I don't see any reason not to, when you consider that you can change back to the stock spring just as easily if it's a problem. If it really bothers you, then do the swap and shoot a few hundred rounds (or whatever you're comfortable with) to make sure that it will reliably set off the primers in your defensive and practice ammunition. If it's less reliable, then switch back to the stock spring.

Then again, heavy and inconsistent triggers are why I switched to striker-fired guns for defense.
