I'm considering replacing the mainspring in my Beretta 92FS to lighten the trigger pull. To my relatively inexperienced hands, the DA trigger pull on this gun feels quite stiff. My friend, who has a _lot_ more experience with firearms than I do, considers it to be remarkably stiff.

Some research on this issue leads me to believe that this problem is often solved by replacing the stock mainspring with the so-called "D" spring (the mainspring from a DAO variant of the Beretta 92).

At this point, I'm not interested in participating in competitions and I don't want to compromise the reliability of the gun. I _would_ like to make the gun more comfortable to shoot and I suspect the force required to operate the gun makes it harder to be accurate.

Given these concerns, does it make sense for me to replace the mainspring in the gun?
