I have trouble closing just one eye at a time and this has been causing problems when trying to shoot a firearm. I know that it's possible and maybe even common to shoot with both eyes open, but I would like to be able to close just one for taking pictures as well, which isn't so easily done with both eyes.

Are there any exercises or things I can do?
