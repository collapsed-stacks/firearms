I have trouble closing just one eye at a time and this has been causing problems when trying to shoot a firearm. I know that it's possible and maybe even common to shoot with both eyes open, but I would like to be able to close just one for taking pictures as well, which isn't so easily done with both eyes.

Are there any exercises or things I can do?

<p>It's is preferable in shooting to keep both eyes open, but that can be difficult for some (and used to be for me).  If you must obscure an eye, try to work toward being able to shoot with both eyes open.  </p>

<p>First, make sure you know which of your eyes is dominant.  It's possible that you "can't" close an eye because you're trying to close your dominant eye.  There are several tests you can try, and which one works best seem to vary with person, so rather than suggest one, I'll let you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=finding%20eye%20dominance">google it</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are using your dominant eye to aim, if you need to obscure your non-dominant eye, start with an eyepatch.  (These are available at most pharmacies and where eyeglasses are sold for a couple of dollars).  Try to progress to a piece of black tape on the lens of your shooting glasses (non-dominant side only, of course) and then a piece of scotch tape.  </p>

<p>One thing you will find, particularly when using iron sights is that a small change to the angle at which you hold your head can make a significant difference.  Play with the idea, but don't rush it - it comes with repetition more than experimentation.</p>

<p>Once you can remove the scotch tape and shoot with both eyes open you are at your best for shooting (and photography).  The vision in your dominant eye will be at its most acute.  </p>

<p>When one eye is closed there is strain in the muscles that focus the eye and the open eye dilates to collect more light.  Of course you also lose some depth perception - all of which are detrimental.</p>

If you can, train with both eyes open (if it works for you, and if you have success with it).  Some people can't, but stay consistent if you choose one way or another.

If you have problems closing one eye, and you want to do it for other purposes, I would recommend just trying to keep one eye closed for any short time period when not on the range.  If you're home and clean up and about, keep one eye closed for some of it.  Rotate that in to some every day routines you do, and eventually you will get better at it.  I don't recommend using anything to keep the eye closed, like an eye-patch.  I think the trick is to train those muscles to behave how you want them to, and something like an eye-patch may not do that.

If you carry a firearm for self defense or keep one on hand for home defense, you need to be training with both eyes open. You don't want to end up closing off half of your field of vision in a firefight.

My $0.02, anyway.
