[Kel-Tec][1] has recently introduced a dual-magazine, slide action shotgun.

Are there any slide action, double barrel shotguns available? Perhaps one that would either disallow sliding the action until both barrels had been fired?

<p>To my knowledge, no. The purpose of a side-by-side or over-under double barrel shotgun is to allow for a quick followup shot. The pump action de-necessitates having two whole barreled actions, and replaces one of them with a magazine and a mechanism for ejecting the old shell and getting a new shell into battery as quickly as the user can rack the fore-end.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS431US431&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=remington%201740" rel="nofollow">Remington 1740</a> is a fairly well known joke in the gun world -- it is a side-by-side pump action shotgun made from a right-handed and left-handed Remington 870 bolted together. Remington has no plans to produce this gun in the factory, to my knowledge.</p>
