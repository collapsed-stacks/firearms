<p>For example, I recently saw a beautiful used Remington <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.350_Remington_Magnum" rel="nofollow">.350 Magnum</a> rifle for sale for a very reasonable price, and in excellent condition. However, when checking on the cost of ammunition, I only saw <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/product/535879/nosler-custom-ammunition-350-remington-magnum-225-grain-partition-spitzer-box-of-20" rel="nofollow">Midway USA</a> having it in stock, and it's $60+ per box of 20 :(</p>

<p>From reviewing the ballistics, and my own personal interest in "funky" calibers, this rifle has a lot of intrigue. However, the extremely high cost of factory ammunition pushes it down <em>my</em> list of possible acquisitions.</p>

<p>Excluding the cost of factory ammunition for the moment, what is the best way to evaluate the cost of use when looking at an "exotic" caliber? How can one most effectively determine defrayed and immediate reloading supplies costs, etc (presuming that the reloading press and powders are already beign acquired for other calibers)?</p>

<p>If you are already set up with loading gear and you want to load another caliber, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a set of dies.  Dies for even really weird and exotic cases don't cost too much more than ordinary calibres.</li>
<li>bullets powder primers - but you might already "stock" these for other calibers you load</li>
<li>brass</li>
</ul>

<p>Brass can be gotten by buying expensive factory ammo or even "collector" ammo at gun shows (you don't need very much; for example, you might be able to get by with 40pcs or 60pcs of brass for the lifetime of your .350 Rem Mag).  If the cartridge belongs to a common family (most do), you can form your brass from another case.  For example the .350 Rem Mag uses the "standard magnum" case, so you ought to be able to make brass for your .350 Rem Mag out of any of the 0.532" belted magnum cases, for example .300 Win Mag, 7mm Rem Mag, .338 Win Mag.</p>
