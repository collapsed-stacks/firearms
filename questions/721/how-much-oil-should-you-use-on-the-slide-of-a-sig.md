<p>I have a P226 9mm and when I bought it the salesman said that Sigs should be run with a decent amount of oil on them.</p>

<p>How much is the right amount?  Should there be visible oil on the slide and side of the frame or is that too much?</p>

<p><a href="http://sigforum.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/430601935/m/908103701" rel="nofollow"><strong>This</strong></a> is an excellent post from the SIGforum that addresses specifically the lubrication requirements of SIG Sauer handguns. Worth a careful read.</p>

<p>You should actually be using grease on a SIG's frame rails.</p>

<p>Sigs are my favorite handguns, but one of my 229s is also the only handgun I've ever had lock up tight as a drum from being run dry, with the slide out of battery no less. </p>

<p>After that, I've keep mine really wet.   After cleaning, I first run a Q-Tip soaked in oil down each slide rail, then work the slide a few times, and finally clean up any excess with a paper towel.   I've never had a problem since, in any scenario from a hundred rounds at the range after a month in the holster, or thousand rounds in a day during training.  </p>

<p>The right amount can be described as "visible but not dripping."  On a slide that means a few drops.  However, it's better to put on too much and wipe off the excess than not to put on enough.  There are also other areas that benefit from oil.  Look for any shiny areas where metal rubs on metal.  Clean and oil after every time you shoot, or once a week if you carry.  Most people also recommend oiling <em>before</em> you shoot if it has been in storage a while, but I don't know many people who actually follow that advice.</p>
