I compete in IDPA with a full-sized 1911, which means my magazines hold 8 rounds. When I start a stage, I can have 8+1 rounds loaded (full mag + 1 in the chamber). If I decide I want to perform a slide-lock reload (as opposed to a tactical reload) after 8 shots, can I, within the rules, underload my magazine such that I start with 7+1 rounds?
