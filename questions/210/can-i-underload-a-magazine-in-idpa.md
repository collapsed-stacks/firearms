I compete in IDPA with a full-sized 1911, which means my magazines hold 8 rounds. When I start a stage, I can have 8+1 rounds loaded (full mag + 1 in the chamber). If I decide I want to perform a slide-lock reload (as opposed to a tactical reload) after 8 shots, can I, within the rules, underload my magazine such that I start with 7+1 rounds?

No.  You have to load your magazines to either the division capacity, or to their full capacity if that is less than the division capacity.  You can't get around this by using a lower capacity magazine on that stage either, you must use the same capacity magazines throughout the match.

See section E on page 23 of the [IDPA rulebook](http://idpa.com/Documents/IDPARuleBook2005.pdf) (pdf link).

If you start with under-loaded magazines, your should receive an FTDR(Failure to do right) penalty from the SO.

By intentionally under-loading a magazine you, you can gain an advantage if the firearm runs dry and goes into slide lock as you are moving between areas and are not engaging targets.

But a tactical reload and reload with retention are both fully legal and allowed.
