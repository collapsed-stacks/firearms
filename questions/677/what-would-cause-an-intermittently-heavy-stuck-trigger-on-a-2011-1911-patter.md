I have been having an intermittent issue with my open gun where the trigger (normally a crisp 1.5 lbs) gets very heavy.  At one point the over-travel screw moved in too far and having corrected that, I thought I'd solved the problem, but I'm still experiencing it.  I can't get the issue to repeat reliably - I'm only seeing it 2-3 times in 300 rounds and it most often seems to follow a reload (another thing that made me think it was the over-travel screw).  Do you think the lightweight '3-finger' spring  may be too weak to reliably operate the disconnector?  I'm fishing here...
