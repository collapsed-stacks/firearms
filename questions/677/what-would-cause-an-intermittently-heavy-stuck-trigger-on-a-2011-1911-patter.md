I have been having an intermittent issue with my open gun where the trigger (normally a crisp 1.5 lbs) gets very heavy.  At one point the over-travel screw moved in too far and having corrected that, I thought I'd solved the problem, but I'm still experiencing it.  I can't get the issue to repeat reliably - I'm only seeing it 2-3 times in 300 rounds and it most often seems to follow a reload (another thing that made me think it was the over-travel screw).  Do you think the lightweight '3-finger' spring  may be too weak to reliably operate the disconnector?  I'm fishing here...

Hmmm - I would think that if the problem is following a reload, I would first look at the trigger bow to make sure it isn't dragging on the magazine.

Next, make sure everything is clean, especially the disconnector channel and followed up by inspecting the sear spring to make sure it isn't bent or otherwise unserviceable.

Also, is the reset of trigger dragging or slower than usual?

Sounds to me like one of your magazines is out of spec enough to grab the trigger bow, similar to what Ray J describes but I'd look for a slightly dented magazine.
