I've seen a couple comments mentioning shooting an AR-15 "wet" or "dry".  I'm trying to figure out what exactly it means to shoot "wet" or "dry".  This is not related to "dry firing".

In the context of an AR-15 type rifle "wet" and "dry" generally refer to the amount of lubrication.  AR type rifles generally don't work well "dry".  They prefer to be run "wet", with a substantial amount of lube.  They don't have to be dripping, but they should be well lubricated.
