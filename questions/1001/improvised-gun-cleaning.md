<p>I'm wondering what your options would be if you didn't have a proper gun cleaning kit available and need to clean your gun. Can a cleaning kit be improvised from natural materials or widely available man-made items? What would you use for solvent, brush, patches, and oil? What about for cleaning corrosive ammunition? </p>

<p>Or, what are the important properties to look for when improvising these items?</p>

<p>Oh heck yes, let's MacGyver a gun cleaning:</p>

<p>A long enough shoestring with the proper sized knot can work like a bore-snake. Helps if you have a piece of split-shot in your BOB to help gravity drop it through the barrel.</p>

<p>Patches can be cut from any cotton (or most synthetic) rag.</p>

<p>A bunch of folks swear by Ed's Red (a mix of transmission fluid, kerosene, and mineral spirits) as the best clp goop out there. Any synthetic motor oil will do a decent job in a pinch.</p>

<p>For corrosive ammo, a little ammonia in lots hot water, followed by your favorite clp type stuff. </p>

<p>Improvised equipment?</p>

<p>I would go with an old toothbrush, some napkins from a fast food joint and synth motor oil.  Pulled from the dip stick of my car, if need be.</p>

<p>If it is an improvised, operational, cleaning rather than a full cleaning, I focus on the big chunks and lube up the working parts.</p>
