I'm wondering what your options would be if you didn't have a proper gun cleaning kit available and need to clean your gun. Can a cleaning kit be improvised from natural materials or widely available man-made items? What would you use for solvent, brush, patches, and oil? What about for cleaning corrosive ammunition? 

Or, what are the important properties to look for when improvising these items?
