I'm wondering what your options would be if you didn't have a proper gun cleaning kit available and need to clean your gun. Can a cleaning kit be improvised from natural materials or widely available man-made items? What would you use for solvent, brush, patches, and oil? What about for cleaning corrosive ammunition? 

Or, what are the important properties to look for when improvising these items?

Oh heck yes, let's MacGyver a gun cleaning:

A long enough shoestring with the proper sized knot can work like a bore-snake. Helps if you have a piece of split-shot in your BOB to help gravity drop it through the barrel.

Patches can be cut from any cotton (or most synthetic) rag.

A bunch of folks swear by Ed's Red (a mix of transmission fluid, kerosene, and mineral spirits) as the best clp goop out there. Any synthetic motor oil will do a decent job in a pinch.

For corrosive ammo, a little ammonia in lots hot water, followed by your favorite clp type stuff.

Improvised equipment?

I would go with an old toothbrush, some napkins from a fast food joint and synth motor oil.  Pulled from the dip stick of my car, if need be.

If it is an improvised, operational, cleaning rather than a full cleaning, I focus on the big chunks and lube up the working parts.
