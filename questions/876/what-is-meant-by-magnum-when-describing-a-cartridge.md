I researched on the Internet and some sources say it is purely a marketing term that indicates that the round is a high-performance "powerful" round, while other sources say that a "magnum" round is slightly longer with more powder to make the round more powerful. 

So when exactly does a round become a "magnum" round? Is it purely marketing or is there a measurable limit before a round can be called a "magnum"?
