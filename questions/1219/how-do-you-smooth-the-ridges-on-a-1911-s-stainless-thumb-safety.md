On my new Springfield Champion .45, the thumb safety has some ridges which are so sharp that I cut my palm few times when racking the slide. Can someone recommend how to smooth the ridges without taking it all apart? It has a stainless steel finish.

I was thinking of using some polishing paste. If this is the right idea, is there some particular kind of paste suitable for this application?
