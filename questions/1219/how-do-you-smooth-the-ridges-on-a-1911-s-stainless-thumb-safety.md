On my new Springfield Champion .45, the thumb safety has some ridges which are so sharp that I cut my palm few times when racking the slide. Can someone recommend how to smooth the ridges without taking it all apart? It has a stainless steel finish.

I was thinking of using some polishing paste. If this is the right idea, is there some particular kind of paste suitable for this application?

I have seen several mentions of using 140 Grit compound, though I think you might be better off using a fine grit paper and doing it by hand to insure you don't slip and or go further then you intended. See: [How to dehorn](http://www.blindhogg.com/gunsmith/dehorning.html).

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000HQICXE" rel="nofollow">Cratex Rubberized Abrasives</a> in a dremel tool are great for smoothing something out when you don't want to remove too much material.  (Google 'cratex' and you can find smaller kits or individual pieces).</p>

<p>I would highly recommend disassembly regardless of how you do it - you won't have to worry about touching the slide or frame or getting 'grit' in your pistol.  Removing the thumb safety is relatively simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take the slide / barrel assembly off the frame just as you would for cleaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease the hammer forward to relieve pressure from the mainspring.</p></li>
<li><p>With a punch, drive out the mainspring pin (the pin at the bottom rear of the butt).</p></li>
<li><p>Slide the mainspring housing down and out of the pistol.</p></li>
<li><p>If the 3-fingered spring falls out at this point, don't worry about it.  It will fall out by the time you've removed the safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the hammer in the cocked position.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting with the thumb safety in the 'fire' position, start pulling the safety out while raising it toward the 'safe' position.  A little bit before it gets all the way to normal 'safe'position it should start to pull out.  This might take a bit of fussing to find the first time.</p></li>
<li><p>As the safety comes out, it frees the plunger in the plunger tube.  It's unlikely to fly away, but watch it.</p></li>
<li><p>Withdraw the safety completely.  If it's an ambidextrous safety the passenger side is removed by rotating it so its 'tail' clears the grip scale.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point the grip safety will fall out (along with the 3-fingered spring if it hasn't already).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>---Go do your work on the safety.  </p>

<p>Re-assembly is just following the directions in reverse with the following exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by placing the 3-fingered spring in position.  The bottom should engage the slot in the bottom back of the frame. </p></li>
<li><p>Push the mainspring part way in place to hold the 3-finger spring in place for the rest of the process.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Don't forget the hammer position ('cocked' when inserting the thumb safety, 'fired' when re-installing the mainspring).  Use a 1/16" punch to depress the thumb safety plunger while pushing the thumb safety home.</p>
