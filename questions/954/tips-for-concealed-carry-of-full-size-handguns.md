I own a Glock 21 (full-size .45ACP).  Although I'm looking at potentially getting a more compact firearm, I really enjoy shooting my Glock and it's definitely the gun I feel most comfortable with.  I'm wanting to start carrying more regularly, but I'm uncertain as to whether I'll be able to tote a full size Glock without printing or showing.  To make things more difficult, I'm a fairly skinny guy, so I have less of a waistline to work with.

Does anyone out there regularly carry a full-sized gun, and if so how do you do it?

I carry a 5" 1911 every single day...  While your body type may challenge you, look at the whole system of carrying:

 - Gun:  Get a normal sized gun (yes, I consider a G21 normal sized) that you are comfortable carrying and are proficient with.  I can't see why you can't conceal a G21.

 - Holster:  A good quality kydex, leather or hybrid inside the waistband holster.  With less waistline, you may want a slight cant (FBI cant of 10 to 20 degrees) of the holster to bring the grip slightly forward on your body as to avoid the "grip print."  A high rise style holster may help conceal a bit by bringing the grip higher above the belt line.  But, it may be a little slower to draw due to having to bring the hand higher to acquire the final firing grip.  

 - Belt:  A belt designed specifically to carry the weight of a gun and support equipment.

 - Clothes:  Fit to carry a gun IWB and baggy enough to break up the print of a handgun on your waist.  If you want to wear tight jeans and a ribbed tshirts, they won't go well concealing a G21.  Avoid solid light colors and look for patterns that will break up the print.

Ray J has excellent suggestions for IWB carry, but I'd like to talk about carrying outside the waistband, which might be easier for thin people.

I carry a full-sized 1911 in an outside-the-waistband holster, under my shirt. For me, it's more comfortable than inside the waistband, though opinions differ. I wear my holster behind my hip (4:30-5 o'clock), with a pretty serious forward cant.

The only difficulty here is that you have to wear shirts that come down past the bottom of the holster and won't rise up past it. If you live in a state that allows concealed carry but not open carry (like Texas, off the top of my head), you'll want to be especially careful about this, because they consider open carrying 'brandishing'. You'll also want shirts that are a little baggy, to hide the 'grip print' Ray J mentioned. For me, it's an excuse to wear button-up shirts, which I think look nice anyway.

No matter where you carry, it's absolutely critical to practice drawing it until it's second nature. You don't want to have to draw and get caught up on your clothing.
