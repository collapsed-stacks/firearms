I own a Glock 21 (full-size .45ACP).  Although I'm looking at potentially getting a more compact firearm, I really enjoy shooting my Glock and it's definitely the gun I feel most comfortable with.  I'm wanting to start carrying more regularly, but I'm uncertain as to whether I'll be able to tote a full size Glock without printing or showing.  To make things more difficult, I'm a fairly skinny guy, so I have less of a waistline to work with.

Does anyone out there regularly carry a full-sized gun, and if so how do you do it?
