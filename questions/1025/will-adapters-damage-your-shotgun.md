## Will adapters damage your shotgun?

I was watching a video recently which demonstrated the use of an adapter such as [this][1] to fire different rounds from a 12 gauge shotgun.  The idea is to increase versatility in a situation where ammo is less available.

How likely is it that using this would harm the *barrel* of the gun?  I'm going to just assume single shot gun.

The shotshell adapters are probably fine, but there's no provision for an extractor so you might need to bump the spent cartridge out with a cleaning rod. [Reviews](http://www.amazon.com/12-Gauge-Mag-Shotgun-Adapter/product-reviews/B004BAVOV4/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1) on Amazon state the pistol cartridge adapters are smooth bore, I'd be a bit more leery of using them. [GaugeMates](http://www.gaugemate.com/purchase/gaugemate-cartridge) might be a better choice with their provision for an extractor, although it appears their _cartridge_ adapters may be smooth bore as well.
