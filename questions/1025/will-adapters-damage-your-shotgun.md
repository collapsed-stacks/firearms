<p>I was watching a video recently which demonstrated the use of an adapter such as <a href="http://www.gunadapters.com/categories/Shotgun-Adapters/12-gauge/" rel="nofollow">this</a> to fire different rounds from a 12 gauge shotgun.  The idea is to increase versatility in a situation where ammo is less available.</p>

<p>How likely is it that using this would harm the <em>barrel</em> of the gun?  I'm going to just assume single shot gun.</p>

<p>The shotshell adapters are probably fine, but there's no provision for an extractor so you might need to bump the spent cartridge out with a cleaning rod. <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004BAVOV4" rel="nofollow">Reviews</a> on Amazon state the pistol cartridge adapters are smooth bore, I'd be a bit more leery of using them. <a href="http://www.gaugemate.com/purchase/gaugemate-cartridge" rel="nofollow">GaugeMates</a> might be a better choice with their provision for an extractor, although it appears their <em>cartridge</em> adapters may be smooth bore as well.</p>
