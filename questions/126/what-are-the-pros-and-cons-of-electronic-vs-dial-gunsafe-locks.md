I am looking to get a new gunsafe, and I would like to know what the pros and cons are of dial locks versus electronic keypad locks. I am looking for:

 - Security
 - Ease of opening
 - Ability to change the combination
 - Long-term reliability

Electronic locks have 2 primary downsides (3 depending on how you look at it).  Failure of a mechanism internally, like a cable that's used to pull a bolt is the first.  Second is the fact that they run on batteries.  Batteries die and you have to unlock it with the key that is provided.  That key is the third piece.  If the bad guys get your key, they don't need a combination, torch, or anything else.  Everything is theirs.

They benefit through ease of opening, provided the combination is known.  I believe turn-dial combinations can also be changed, but you'll need to research that one yourself I think.  Some companies probably don't provide that feature.

Rotary dial (manual) combinations are slow to open and VERY difficult to open at night.  Without a light, they're all but impossible to open.

One suggestion I've seen elsewhere is to keep a bedside safe with an electronic combination while your big safe has a rotary dial lock since it's no longer going to be necessary in an emergency.

I can't see myself being able to open combination lock at night and in emergency situation.
So I got myself safe with electronic lock. Fingerprint lock may be even better but
the more advanced is the electronics the higher is the chance that it will in most critical moment.
