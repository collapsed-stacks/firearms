I'm looking to use a ballistic calculator to set up a good drop table for one of my rifles, but I don't have access to a chronograph.  Hornady claims that their 168 grain .308 A-MAX load achieves 2700 feet per second from a 24 inch barrel (same length as my rifle, so that's not a variable).  Given such an even number, I have some suspicion that there's some rounding going on.  Has anyone chronoed this round to verify Hornady's velocity claims?
