Something I've been wondering for a while but never found anyone to ask.

How does a gun, let's say for example, an M16 know how many shots to fire off?

I know that you can obviously change the lever on the side from safety, to semi auto, to full auto but how do the internals of the gun know how many rounds to shoot?

Cheers
