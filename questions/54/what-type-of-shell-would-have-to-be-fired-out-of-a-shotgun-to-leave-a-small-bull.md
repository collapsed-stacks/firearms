Near the end of Jurassic Park, Dr. Grant fires the shotgun three times at a Velociraptor through a window.  When the camera gets to the window we find three 9mm sized bullet holes.

What type of shell would be required to duplicate this action?
Are there commercial shells available that would have this effect?
