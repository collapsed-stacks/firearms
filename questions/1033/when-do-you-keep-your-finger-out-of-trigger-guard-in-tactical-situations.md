We are always taught to keep finger out of trigger guard until sights are on the target. But what about situations when you may be required to shoot immediately but didn't point your gun yet to the target? For example, some sketchy people approach you at night and you draw your gun preventatively? 

So do you always keep finger out of trigger guard or are there tactical scenarios where it may be more practical to have it on the trigger?
