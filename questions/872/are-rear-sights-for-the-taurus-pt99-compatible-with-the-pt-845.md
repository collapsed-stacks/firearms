I want to put a Burris FastFire II on my Taurus PT-845. Burris makes a mount for the PT99. Does anyone know if the cut for the rear sight on the PT99 is the same as the one on the PT-845?

Without having them in hand, it's hard to say for certain. However, according to at least one customer, the part advertised for the PT99 does not [fit](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/889671/burris-fastfire-base-beretta-92-96-taurus-pt99-matte).
It looks like it may actually be designed for Taurus's PT92's style of sight.
