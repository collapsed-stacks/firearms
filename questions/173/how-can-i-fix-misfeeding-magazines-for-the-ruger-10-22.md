I have some magazines that seem to misfeed frequently. Any suggestions on how to fix this? They are the plastic type and I am worried about taking them apart to tension or replace the springs.

Many aftermarket magazines available for the Ruger 10/22 perform poorly.  Until recently 25 rounders were only available from other manufacturers. Ruger now manufactures a 25 rounder which has been reviewed as reliable:

Ruger claims the feed lip angle is a critical factor overlooked in the unreliable magazines produced by others.

If your magazine is otherwise in functional condition (clean, assembled correctly, etc.) and is not feeding properly, you may be able to modify the feed lips for better functionality, but you may have better luck just replacing any magazine whose performance is questionable.

<strong>Manually stretching or compressing springs will ruin them.</strong> They are designed to be at a specific tension and length to function properly, and changing that will dramatically shorten their lives. 

The magazines I've had for my 10/22 have always been fixed by cleaning if they were fixable. Unfortunately not all of them were. For a gun like this, high-quality and high-reliability parts are generally not available like they are for platforms like the AR-15. 

Luckily, they're relatively cheap.
