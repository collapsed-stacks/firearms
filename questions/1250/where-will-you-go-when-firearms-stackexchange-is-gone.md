<p>Lots of options available:</p>

<p>highroad
weaponeer
homegunsmith
garagegunsmithing
ar15
reddit/r/guns</p>

<p>None of them have precisely the stack exchange format, which to me means more chaff, less wheat.  What do you think?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/guns" rel="nofollow" title="reddit">reddit/r/guns</a></p>

<p><a href="http://calguns.net" rel="nofollow" title="Calguns">calguns.net</a></p>

<p>wherever else</p>

<p>Maybe the firearms.SE.com archives... This is such a shame. My complaints are hollow, since i didn't contribute until now. Are the Q&amp;As here available now or will it take a while? The <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/164/firearms">area51 proposal</a> has no download link that i can see.</p>

<p>I don't know what it is about non-computer topic forums. There are comp. usenet forums over 30 years old, they don't die due to lack of use. It's a "channel" issue in IMHO, many users in this field are accustomed to the forum board posting style. Even though you're clicking through pages and pages to read a thread, you can't reply using email, or even quote a poster without additional effort.</p>

<p>The reason this site failed is that it wasn't aggressively marketed to those established channels or advertised that it even existed. If you don't set out to create and sustain a community, it's success becomes the luck of the draw, and it appears that we're out of luck. Great, now firearms knowledge can fall back into obscurity where I need to find that "guy" who's a walking encyclopedia but can't be bothered to write any of it down.</p>

<p>This doesn't have to be the end, we could re-group, start developing a marketing campaign (blog, twitter, facebook, etc) and revitalize the community. I just can't do the forum format, it's a waste of time, extra login/passwords (I have 23). Overall I'm pretty shocked at the news, I didn't even know that this was a problem.</p>
