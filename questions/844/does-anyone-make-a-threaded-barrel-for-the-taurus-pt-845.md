<p>No, there are no aftermarket barrels for this pistol. You might have to get one custom machined if you can find a shop near you. I don't know of any web based shops other than <a href="http://www.storm-lake.com/products/barrel/builder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.storm-lake.com/products/barrel/builder/</a> but they don't do taurus</p>
