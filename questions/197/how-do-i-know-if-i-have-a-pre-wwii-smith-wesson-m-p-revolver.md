How can I tell the date of manufacture of a Smith & Wesson M&P revolver? If it's not possible to pin it down to a specific year, what would tell me whether it was pre or post WWII?

In a lot of cases, the serial number can get you pretty close.

[Answer from OldFluff on TheHighRoad.org](http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-139745.html)
> Smith and Wesson ended their original serial number series at 999,999 on or about April 24, 1942, and started over at "1" with a "V" prefix. In late 1944 they incorporated a new safety and changed the prefix to "SV." At the war's end they were up to SV 811000. 

You can also [contact Smith and Wesson directly](http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Category4_750001_750051_757825_-1_757814_757812_image). It looks like there's a fee involved.
