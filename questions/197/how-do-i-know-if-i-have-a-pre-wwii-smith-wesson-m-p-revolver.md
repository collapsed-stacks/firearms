<p>How can I tell the date of manufacture of a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P revolver? If it's not possible to pin it down to a specific year, what would tell me whether it was pre or post WWII?</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, the serial number can get you pretty close.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smith and Wesson ended their original serial number series at 999,999 on or about April 24, 1942, and started over at "1" with a "V" prefix. In late 1944 they incorporated a new safety and changed the prefix to "SV." At the war's end they were up to SV 811000. </p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Category4_750001_750051_757825_-1_757814_757812_image" rel="nofollow">contact Smith and Wesson directly</a>. It looks like there's a fee involved.</p>
