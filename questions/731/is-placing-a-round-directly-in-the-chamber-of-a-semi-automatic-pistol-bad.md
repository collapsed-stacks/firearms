## Is placing a round directly in the chamber of a semi-automatic pistol bad?

<p>Following up on a comment from <a href="http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/117/is-there-any-real-danger-in-chambering-the-same-round-multiple-times-without-fir">Is there any real danger in chambering the same round multiple times without firing it?</a>, I want to know more about the potential risks of placing a round directly in the chamber and inserting a full magazine rather than chambering a round from the magazine and then topping off the magazine. Can anyone verify and elaborate?</p>

<p>It depends on the type of extractor used.  In the original 1911 design, the extractor is meant for <em>controlled feed</em>  - that means the rim should slide up under the extractor in normal use. As such it doesn't have the range of travel desired for regularly snapping over the rim of a cartridge. The 1911 with an external extractor (like the Dan Wesson models that never worked and the Kimber models that almost worked a little) could snap over a round without risking damage.  Glock extractors are unlikely to be damaged by closing on a chambered round.  You really need to examine the travel of your particular extractor type to make a determination.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the way a round slides up from the magazine is more gentle on your extractor than slamming it over the rim of the cartridge. So, manually chambering a round and then dropping the slide can wear your extractor unduly.</p>

<p>It can also chew up the rim of the case. Combined with, as Chris said, wearing your extractor, you can be setting yourself up for some failures to eject.</p>
