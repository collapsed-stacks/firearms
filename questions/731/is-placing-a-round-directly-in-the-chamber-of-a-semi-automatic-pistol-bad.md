Following up on a comment from [Is there any real danger in chambering the same round multiple times without firing it?](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/117/is-there-any-real-danger-in-chambering-the-same-round-multiple-times-without-fir), I want to know more about the potential risks of placing a round directly in the chamber and inserting a full magazine rather than chambering a round from the magazine and then topping off the magazine. Can anyone verify and elaborate?
