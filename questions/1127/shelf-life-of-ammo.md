<p>I have many rounds of ammunition that I bought years ago.  How long is its shelf life expected to be? </p>

<p>I know the answer is likely to depend on temperature and humidity, but if you aren't expecting to keep boxes on the shelf, you don't pay attention to the environment.</p>

<p>If you're keeping ammo in a climate controlled environment (e.g. in your house), it will last approximately forever. If you're keeping it in the garage, basement, or somewhere where humidity might get to it, ammunition will last a couple of years before corroding. If you look at it and don't see any rust / obvious corrosion, you'll be fine. There are military surplus enthusiasts who regularly shoot ammunition produced before WWII. Ammo lasts.</p>
