I'm just starting to reload pistol cartridges. For now, I'm looking to copy a factory round for range time, not do anything custom. I haven't gone through the entire process yet as I'm waiting for all of the equipment to arrive. I've got a progressive press coming with a size/depriming die. I have already cleaned several hundred cases with the spent primer left in. Would it be better to de-prime the cases before cleaning in a vibrating cleaner? If so, would I just run the dirty cases through the sizing/de-prime die? Will that cause any problems with the die or press?
