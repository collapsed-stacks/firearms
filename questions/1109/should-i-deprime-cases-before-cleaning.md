## Should I deprime cases before cleaning?

I'm just starting to reload pistol cartridges. For now, I'm looking to copy a factory round for range time, not do anything custom. I haven't gone through the entire process yet as I'm waiting for all of the equipment to arrive. I've got a progressive press coming with a size/depriming die. I have already cleaned several hundred cases with the spent primer left in. Would it be better to de-prime the cases before cleaning in a vibrating cleaner? If so, would I just run the dirty cases through the sizing/de-prime die? Will that cause any problems with the die or press?

Most (as in 99%) reloaders will tumble (clean) their cases with the spent primer in place.  Doing so keeps tumbling media from clogging the primer pocket and flash hole.  If you choose to tumble after de-priming, get a 'universal decapping tool' to poke primers out.  Running dirty brass through your sizing die may scratch the die and will scratch the brass.
