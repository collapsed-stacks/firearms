I've seen scopes mounted to AR-15 carry handles before, via a special mount.  It looks like a picatinny rail on top and is designed to attach to the carry handle in a way that makes it a horizontal mounting surface on top.  I have no idea what this type of adapter is called though.  Would like to have one for my collection, so I can occasionally stick a scope on my A2 top AR-15, but it's hard to order something that I don't know the name of...  :-)
