I'm looking for a gun for target shooting and home defense. I was looking at a 9MM but from what I have read a 9mm has more penetration then I want. I was looking at a .45acp because it has the stopping power I want, but wont go though several walls. 

Also should I look at a semi-auto or a revolver and why?
