<p>I want to buy a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Pro 9mm. It comes with a 17 round magazine. But I live in the state of New York and I am limited to 10 round magazines. Are there any 10 round magazines that will fit this pistol?</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes. I fed google the words <code>S&amp;W</code> <code>M&amp;P</code> <code>10</code> <code>round</code> <code>magazine</code> <code>9mm</code> and found <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/product/162724/smith-and-wesson-magazine-s-and-w-m-and-p-compact-9mm-luger-10-round-with-finger-rest-steel-blue" rel="nofollow">this link</a> right away.</p>

<p>If you are buying the gun from an gun store in NY, it will come with the correct legal magazine. If you order it from out of state, you'll have to transfer it to a NY store and that store shouldn't let you take possession of a magazine that isn't legal. I don't know what the laws are about used firearms and magazines in New York, I would research those before buying it used.</p>

<p>I bought a M&amp;P 9L from Express Police Supply and they swapped out the 17 rd mags for 10 round mags. </p>
