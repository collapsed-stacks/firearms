I have a Mossberg 20 gauge (pump) bought for other reasons.  My club has regular trap shoots, and I'd like to try to see if this is a type of shooting that I would like.  My family shot skeet during a vacation, with my wife and youngest son using a 20 gauge.  Is it totally beyond the pale to show up with such a gun at a public shoot, understanding that I'd upgrade to a dedicated gun if trap fits my interests?
