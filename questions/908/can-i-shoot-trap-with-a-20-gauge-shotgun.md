<p>I have a Mossberg 20 gauge (pump) bought for other reasons.  My club has regular trap shoots, and I'd like to try to see if this is a type of shooting that I would like.  My family shot skeet during a vacation, with my wife and youngest son using a 20 gauge.  Is it totally beyond the pale to show up with such a gun at a public shoot, understanding that I'd upgrade to a dedicated gun if trap fits my interests?</p>

<p>If approaching any new shooting event, I think you should start with shoot what you already own. Bringing a 20ga is completely acceptable. Many high-end trap guns are sold in 20ga. It's far more important that the gun fit you. </p>

<p>The 12ga shells will have more pellets, but it's not so much to make that big of a difference. You'll basically miss some targets that you really would have just barely hit with a 12ga. If you shoot doubles, you could be at a disadvantage with the pump action. vs. a semi-auto or double barrel. But if you're already shooting skeet with this gun then you're likely good enough working the action for it not to be an issue.</p>

<p>20 ga. is fine for trap - not even a disadvantage really, since many shooters will be using very light 'target' loads in their 12ga.  What <em>is</em> important is the choke on your shotgun.  If it's a Modified or Improved with a standard length barrel you're good to go.  If it's a minimum length barrel with a Cylinder (i.e. no) choke, you're going to have trouble.</p>

<p>Absolutely!   In fact,  If recoil is an issue for you at all,  The right 20ga. can actually make you look more like a pro -- as you will be more relaxed, and more focused on the target.
There  will be about 40% fewer pellets in the pattern than the equivalent 12ga load would have -- so choose your choke accordingly.   But given that,  I'd say your going to do better with a gun that's comfortable to point, shoot, and reload -- because then you can focus on the more important factors in hitting a random moving target: lead, range, and timing</p>

<p>Absolutely, my mom shoots trap with a 20 gauge.  One of my girlfriends used to embarrass people by showing up with .410 and break 20+.  It's a little tougher because you're throwing fewer pellets into the air, but it'll work just fine, and nobody will really notice that it's a 20.</p>
