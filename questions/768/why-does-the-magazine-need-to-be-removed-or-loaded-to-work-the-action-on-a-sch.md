## Why does the magazine need to be removed (or loaded) to work the action on a Schmidt-Rubin?

When demonstrating the action for a friend recently, I discovered that the magazine either has to have at least one round in it, or be removed for the bolt to be closed once opened.

What is the purpose on the Schmidt-Rubin of disallowing the bolt to be closed if the magazine is empty?
