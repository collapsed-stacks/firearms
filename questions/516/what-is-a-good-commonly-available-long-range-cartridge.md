I am interested in playing around with some long range shooting and am wondering what a good cartridge to build a gun around cheaply would be. By regular cartridge I mean something common and widely available like .308, .270, 30-06 or something along these lines as appossed to a .338 lapua or a .222 magnum.

I'd stick with .308 for the following reasons:

 - Popular in many circles, from competition to hunting to military and law enforcement
 - Looooong history, giving it plenty of available information from reloading recipes and scope dopes to ballistics and wound profiles in all manner of target types
 - Available from basically every single manufacturer of everything to do with ammo, from reloading components to factory loaded ammo
 - Available across many platforms, from fighting guns like the SCAR-H, low- and high-end bolt-action rifles made by everybody from Remington to Accuracy International, and semi-auto precision guns from a number of makers
 - Large orders of factory loaded ammo can be purchased for usually cheaper than many other calibers with smaller followings, allowing you <strong>more practice</strong> for less money
 - Huge aftermarket for things like suppressors and muzzle brakes
 - For killing living things it can be good all the way out to 600 meters very reliably, and depending on your skill (luck) to 800 meters â€” you can extend its usable range with <strong>more practice</strong>
 - For killing paper or steel it can be good out to past 1,000 meters
 - It's a good intermediate caliber with easily-managed recoil and muzzle blast, meaning you can get <strong>more practice</strong> without beating yourself up
 - Can be used on <em>almost</em> all the things you'll be allowed to hunt in the lower 48 of the United States

You specifically mentioned .338 Lapua, I would recommend against this as it's the opposite of nearly every point I made above. It is very expensive, meaning you will practice less. It is a hard-hitting round on both ends, meaning you'll beat yourself up quicker and you'll practice less. It's good out to way past 1500 meters, but until you're a hot-shot precision shooter you're just going to be throwing money into the wind at those ranges.

<strong>I'd stick with the .308 simply because while it may not be the best at everything, it's <em>really really good</em> at a lot of things and if you're still learning, you won't push its limits for a good long while.</strong> It has a lot of intangible benefits that will make learning more enjoyable (easily managed recoil), easier (tons of available ballistic/reloading info, aftermarket, flexibility of platform), cheaper (reloading components and factory ammo massively available, flexibility of platform), and faster (you'll <strong>practice more</strong>).

I like .308 and 30-06 both.

.308 has a little more drop at range than 30-06 because of a lower muzzle velocity but .308 has a shorter action which I like

I don't think you could go wrong with either one of these cartridges

- Paper Targets @ 1000+ yds/M .308 win or .300 Winchester Magnum 180 to 220 grain Balistic Tips
- Elk/deer @ 600 yds/m .300 Remington ULTRA Magnum 7 or .338 Winchester Magnum 180-200gr Barnes TTX, Nosler 180-220gr partition

.300RUM is best all around cartridge for all sports! It's accurate at long ranges and is a freight train when it gets there!

308 is out of energy and really drops fast after 400 yards!

A few words on CHEAP FAST GOOD.  **You only get two** of the three! Cheap and fast isn't good; cheap and good isn't fast; good and fast isn't cheap!
I find this is a reality of life and haven't got all three of these at the same time yet!
Applies to shooting, hunting, and quality of life!
