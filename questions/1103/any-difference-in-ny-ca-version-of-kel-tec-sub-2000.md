<p>Is there any difference in Sub 2000s for CA/NY in the rifles themselves or is it just a different magazine that's included? Is there anything that prevents them from accepting higher-capacity magazines?</p>

<p>There are differences, but only minor.</p>

<p>CA legal Sub2000s cannot have a detachable magazine and must have an overall length of 30" or greater.  Some manufacturers in CA are modifying factory Sub2000s to comply with CA law.</p>

<p>NY's assault weapon ban is written differently than CA's and Sub2000s may have a detachable magazine and the OAL does comply with the penal code.  The Sub2000s shipped to NY can accept magazines whose capacity exceed 10 rounds.  </p>
