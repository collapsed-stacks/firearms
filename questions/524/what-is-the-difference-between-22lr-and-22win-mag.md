<p>What are the differences between the .22LR and .22Win Magnum cartridges (besides the obvious size difference). Does .22Mag have a higher velocity than .22LR? What are the breech pressures for .22Mag?<br>
Would higher velocities provide more accuraccy at longer ranges than .22LR?</p>

<p>Accuracy is, in general, more a function of the rifle than the round for comparable projectile sizes. The advantage of the higher velocity round is it will retain more energy at a longer distance and show less "drop" over the same distance. (Nothing magic, the faster round covers the same distance in less time, therefor gravity has not been acting on it as long as it has on the slower round within that distance)</p>
