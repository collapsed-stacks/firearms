<p>The trigger on my M&amp;P is nice, but I find it is hard to find the reset on the trigger. I want my trigger reset to be more like a Glock where it makes an audible sound and I can feel it with my trigger finger.</p>

<p>How would I make that happen?</p>

<p>To change the trigger reset you will need to replace the <code>sear</code>, <code>striker block</code>, and <code>sear spring</code>. You can either take it to a gunsmith and have him work on the stock parts or on custom made parts, or get a kit with all the parts you need. The most popular kit in the communities of people who run their guns very very hard is the <a href="https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid35.html">Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit by Apex</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The APEX Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit (DCAEK) was designed to
  provide the M&amp;P (9 mm, .357 Sig &amp; .40 only) pistol owner a smooth,
  consistent 5 - 5.5 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter
  over-travel and reduced reset.  The kit includes:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>APEX Hard Sear (9 mm, .357 Sig &amp; .40 series) - NOT FOR .45 ACP APEX</li>
  <li>M&amp;P Ultimate Striker Block Kit (USB kit) APEX M&amp;P Increased Rate Sear</li>
  <li>Spring &amp; Trigger Return Spring (aluminum slave pin included)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As they say on the site in the detailed description, this will not change the pre-load on the trigger, also called up-take or pre-travel. Apex makes a kit that will change these but recommends it for only competition use.</p>

<p>Another product available from Apex is called the <a href="https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid44.html">RAM</a>. From their site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (Patent Pending) is a drop in part
  engineered to improve tactile trigger reset of your M&amp;P pistol.  Along
  with improving the felt reset, the Apex RAM also serves as a failsafe
  in the unlikely event of a Trigger Return Spring breakage; keeping the
  trigger bar properly positioned under the sear and allowing the user
  to manually manipulate the trigger forward between shots.</p>
