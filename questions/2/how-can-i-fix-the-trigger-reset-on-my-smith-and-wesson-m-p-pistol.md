The trigger on my M&P is nice, but I find it is hard to find the reset on the trigger. I want my trigger reset to be more like a Glock where it makes an audible sound and I can feel it with my trigger finger.

How would I make that happen?

To change the trigger reset you will need to replace the `sear`, `striker block`, and `sear spring`. You can either take it to a gunsmith and have him work on the stock parts or on custom made parts, or get a kit with all the parts you need. The most popular kit in the communities of people who run their guns very very hard is the <a href="https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid35.html">Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit by Apex</a>.

> consistent 5 - 5.5 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter
> over-travel and reduced reset.  The kit includes:

>  - APEX Hard Sear (9 mm, .357 Sig & .40 series) - NOT FOR .45 ACP APEX
>  - M&P Ultimate Striker Block Kit (USB kit) APEX M&P Increased Rate Sear
>  - Spring & Trigger Return Spring (aluminum slave pin included)

As they say on the site in the detailed description, this will not change the pre-load on the trigger, also called up-take or pre-travel. Apex makes a kit that will change these but recommends it for only competition use.

Another product available from Apex is called the <a href="https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid44.html">RAM</a>. From their site:

> The Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (Patent Pending) is a drop in part
> engineered to improve tactile trigger reset of your M&P pistol.  Along
> with improving the felt reset, the Apex RAM also serves as a failsafe
> in the unlikely event of a Trigger Return Spring breakage; keeping the
> trigger bar properly positioned under the sear and allowing the user
> to manually manipulate the trigger forward between shots.
