I am trying to completely strip my glock 19.

How do I remove the firing pin to clean the pin, spring and housing around the striker?

I cannot remove the rear slide plate and I don't want to force this.

Field strip the gun and set the slide on the table muzzle down, with the bottom facing towards you.  Look at the rear of the slide at the slot where the bottom of the striker is visible.  At the forward end of that slot you should see a small bit of black plastic.  This is the bottom of the spacer sleeve.  Push this piece of plastic down (towards the muzzle).  The canonical tool for this is the Glock disassembly tool, but you can do it with a ballpoint pen.  While holding the spacer sleeve down, you should be able to carefully slide the rear plate towards you.  The extractor spring bearing is also held in by the rear plate, make sure that doesn't try to launch itself out of the slide when you pull the rear plate off.  With the rear plate removed you should be able to remove the striker and extractor spring bearing.

To reassemble, insert the striker assembly and extractor spring bearing (the plastic end should be towards the rear of the slide).  Press both of these down and slide in the rear plate.
