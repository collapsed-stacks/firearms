<p>I've read various conflicting things, especially on suppressors that have aluminum baffles.  </p>

<p>It seems to be the case that it isn't the ultrasonic cleaner that is the problem, it is the choice of fluid used <em>in</em> the ultrasonic cleaner that makes a difference.</p>

<p>For example, from the AAC Pilot manual: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING </p>
  
  <p>DO NOT use an ultrasonic cleaner on this or any silencer that features anodized aluminum 
  construction. The chemicals used in many ultrasonic cleaners will remove the anodized finish
  and damage the aluminum components. Such damage will not be repaired under warranty. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that would appear to indicate it is more about the chemical than the ultrasonic cleaner itself.</p>

<p>Using something as aggressive as an ultra-sonic cleaner is not necessary; using a non-amonia-based solvent and soaking the suppressor is sufficient. </p>
