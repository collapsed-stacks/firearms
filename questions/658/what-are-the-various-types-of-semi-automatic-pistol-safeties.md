<p>There are a number of safeties are installed and designed into modern handguns.  Here is a short list of common safety features on modern handguns:</p>

<p>Firing pin safety.  A block actuated by a plunger that inhibits the forward motion of the firing pin into and past the breech face.  There are usually defeated by the act of pressing the trigger (Series 80 1911s and the vast majority of modern designs, Glock, HK, Sig, etc) or the grip safety (Schwartz style on Kimber Series II and S&amp;W 1911s).</p>

<p>Disconnector.  Prevents the discharge of a shot when the gun is out of battery by “disconnecting” the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship until the slide is forward and in battery.</p>

<p>Trigger Safety.  Most common on Glocks, a pivoting and spring loaded block that prevents rearward motion of the trigger unless a finger or other object covers the center face of the trigger, defeating the block.</p>

<p>Manual Safety.  A manual switch that prevents rearward travel of the trigger (1911) or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.  Some manual safeties lock the slide as well (1911, Taurus PT92.)</p>

<p>Grip Safety.  Usually on the backstap of the gun, depressing the grip safety unblocks the trigger or ensures the proper trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship.</p>

<p>Squeeze Cocker.  Exclusively on the HK P7, the squeeze action of the grip safety (cocker) on the front strap cocks the gun and allows it to be fired when the trigger is pressed in SA.  </p>

<p>Safety Intercept Notch.  An oversized cut in the hammer of DA/SA or SA pistols to intercept the hammer in the case of sear failure.  Also known as "half cock" on 1911 style firearms.</p>

<p>Loaded Chamber Indicator.  Visual and possible tactile indication that there is a round chambered.  Most modern handguns will have the extractor geometry (Glock, HK) to indicate whether there is a round chambered.  Other firearms may have a separate component doing as such (Springfield XD) while others have have a simple hole in the chamber for visual confirmation.</p>

<p>Decocker.  Safely decocks and lowers the hammer from Single Action to Double Action without the need to press the trigger.  Can block the firing pin striker (Beretta 92 series with decock) and/or maintains the integrity of the firing pin safety function.</p>

<p>Magazine Disconnect.  Prevents the rearward motion of the trigger or interferes with the trigger/sear or hammer/sear relationship when there is no magazine inserted into the gun.</p>

<p>To list the Pros and Cons of each style would be an exercise in futility, as the relative value of each safety feature is going to be objective from shooter to shooter.  Most modern firearms are going to have a number of passive safety features that are mandated due to import guidelines or “gun safety” laws in varied jurisdictions.  It would be very difficult to find a modern handgun design that does not incorporate a firing pin safety, disconnector, safety intercept notch (on hammer fired DA/SA handguns).  On guns with light single action only trigger presses (1911, XD, P7), you will be hard-pressed finding a gun without an external safety and/or grip style safety.      </p>
