<p>Here is a <a href="http://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=147670" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> about two gun shooting practiced (presumably) by Soviet counter intelligence forces around WWII. </p>

<p>I wonder if anyone tried it and was able to reach any sensible results. If it makes sense at all, how would one practice it? </p>

<p>Are there other known two hand techniques? </p>

<p>I've never heard a compelling argument for a gun in each hand. </p>

<p>Your eyes can't focus independently and thus you can only aim one gun at a time. You'll either be less accurate or much slower, which would to me negate any advantage you may think the second gun gives you. </p>

<p>Works great if you're a video game character or movie star though. </p>

<p>There are two scenarios that make sense: (1) cover/retreat fire when you don't have anything else for slinging lead, and (2) in the movies because it "looks cool."  Your scenario of intelligence forces makes me think it's more the former: intel guys are going to travel light and might be able to conceal a couple handguns but not a submachine gun.  If they need to lay down cover fire (for a hasty retreat?), then shooting two pistols might be the only method available to them of dumping lead down range... it just won't be accurate.</p>
