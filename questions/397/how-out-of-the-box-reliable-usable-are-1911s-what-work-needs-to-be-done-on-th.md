## How out of the box reliable/usable are 1911s, what work "needs" to be done on them?

This question is probably poorly worded, rewrite appreciated. 

I am interested in the 1911 platform. The internet opinion ranges from "gods gift to gunners" to "the most finickey thing ever, don't buy one unless you can afford $1k having a gunsmith make it work correctly".

I am a new shooter, looking for my first handgun, and I like the long term reliability, availablity of aftermarket, compatability across vendors, etc  - But I will not be in a position to tinker with it endlessley, or afford to have a gunsmith rebuild it. I pretty much just need it to "work".

This gun is intended for both range/learning, home defense, and possible (but unlikely) CCW. 

I was attracted to some of the more compact models (kimber, springfield micro), and am aware that the compact's have a worse reputation for reliability.
