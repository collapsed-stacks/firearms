I have a Walther PPK chambered for .380 ACP. I looked it up in a gun book once to get detailed specs on it, and it listed the calibers as "7.62mm (.32 ACP) and 9x17mm/.380 ACP", and another one didn't even list .380. Are 9x17mm and .380 ACP just different names for the same cartridge, or are they different but just listed together?
