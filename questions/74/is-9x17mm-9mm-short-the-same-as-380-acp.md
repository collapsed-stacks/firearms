I have a Walther PPK chambered for .380 ACP. I looked it up in a gun book once to get detailed specs on it, and it listed the calibers as "7.62mm (.32 ACP) and 9x17mm/.380 ACP", and another one didn't even list .380. Are 9x17mm and .380 ACP just different names for the same cartridge, or are they different but just listed together?

9mm short, 9x17mm and .380 ACP are synonymous, according to Wikipedia.

They are referencing Barnes, Frank C., ed. Amber, John T., Cartridges Of The World (3d Edition), (DBI, 1978)

As stated above .380 Auto, .380 ACP, 9mm Browning Short, are all names for the same cartridge (designed by John Moses Browning for pistols manufactured by Colt hence the ACP name, Auotmatic Colt Pistol) Also 9mm short, 9mm Kurz (Kurz is German for "Short") and 9mm Corto (Corto is Italian for "Short").
