 How do their features compare?  Weight, balance, safety mechanism, etc.

<p>The Glock 25 is kind of an oddball. It's unusually large for a .380, being the same size as the Glock 19 (9mm) and and Glock 23 (.40S&amp;W) pistols, so I don't know of any guns that are <em>highly</em> similar.</p>

<p>The Diamondback DB380 has a very Glock-like look in a smaller package if that's what you're after.</p>

<p>If you want <strong>maximum concealability</strong> look at the Kel-Tec P-3AT, Ruger LCP, and S&amp;W Bodyguard 380 which are all similar in size and design. These are all relatively new guns, while the Glock 25 uses the same well-proven design as all Glocks.</p>

<p>If you're looking for <strong>similar form-factor</strong> you could look at any of the M&amp;Ps, XDMs or other large handguns in 9mm or .40.</p>

<p>If you're interested in guns with similarly long <strong>track records</strong> you could look at the Bersa Thunder, Beretta Cheetah, the Walther PPK, or the CZ 83. (I'm not saying they have <em>equally good</em> track records, just that they're <em>long</em> enough that you can judge for your self)</p>
