I'm a large guy, and as such I have larger hands, which leads to hand guns not fitting quite right (either horixontally or vertically on the grip).  Are there any larger .45 pistols that might fit better than an M1911?

<p>In short, the best advice anyone can give you is to go into a gun shop and put your hands on all of the guns that people are suggesting here. Buy the gun that feels best in your hand - not what someone said you should like on the internet :).</p>

<p>Now, I will add a gun to the list that hasn't been suggested yet which is the Springfield XD-M. Like the Glock and the S&amp;W M&amp;P it too has interchangeable back straps. The .45 version of the XD-M holds 13+1 rounds. To see a full list of specs check it out <a href="http://www.the-m-factor.com/html/specs_6.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I am a big fan of the 1911 family as well, so you may want to check out a double stacked 1911, there are a gun makers in this field including Springfield Armory, STI, Para, and more.</p>

You can try the [Para Ordnance 14-45](http://www.para-usa.com/new/product_pistol.php?id=69), it's a double stack 1911 that might fit your hand better. Or if you prefer a double action type trigger, the Ruger P90 may suit, though it looks like it's out of production. Keep in mind, you're going to have to handle any firearm first to make sure it fit's well. There are also grips from manufacturers like [Hogue](http://www.getgrip.com/main/overview/semi.html) that may fatten up the standard 1911 enough for you.

The Glock G21 might be right up your alley. The latest generation comes with several different backstraps, so you can find the one that fits your hand best.

Most of the double-stack semi-autos are going to be suitable folks with larger hands.  The Glock 21, XD .45, the fullsize HK USP and Mark 23, and Para Ordinance double-stack pistols all fit this category.  

Be aware that there are some 'double stack' .45s that are more like stack-and-a-half, rather than true double stacks.  The narrower magazines are intended to make it easier for people with average hands to grip them, but it kind of undermines those of us with large hands.  These include the M&P .45, the HK USP Compact and HK45.  Basically any fullsize .45 with a mag capacity of 10 rounds or less probably has a narrower than true double-stack magazine.

Personally, I've got fairly big mitts and find that the Glock 21 fits me like a glove.  I still love my 21, even though I've mostly switched to a 17 these days.

The FNP-45 is a true double-stack .45, has a fairly large grip, and is a high quality, accurate and reliable firearm to boot. It comes standard with a 15 round magazine and two extra 14 round magazines. It also has a picatinny rail for mounting a light or a laser under the barrel.

The Sig P220 is a large framed gun, and especially so if you get one of the versions with the wood grips, such as the Elite which can add noticeably to the width of the grip.

HK also makes some .45s that are suited to huge hands, like the Mark 23.

The Smith & Wesson M&P comes with 3 different sets of grips, small, medium & large, and they're switchable in about 30 seconds. I have smaller hands and the small ones work well for both my wife & I. You can also check them out at the store, so you don't have to install an aftermarket grip part to get a feel for it.

Other than everything already mentioned, the "standard" 1911 with a curved mainspring housing fits big hands quite comfortable as well, despite being a single-stack. The upside here is you get a lot of variety, and it's easy to slap on some fatter, aftermarket grips to expand it a little. My dad has pretty big paws and a Hogue wrap-around grip and curved mainspring housing fill them up pretty well.
