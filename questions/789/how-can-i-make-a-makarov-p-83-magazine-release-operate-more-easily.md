I recently traded in a P-83 Wanad and got a Bulgarian Makarov.  The magazine release is extremely tight and you need to push it with your thumb while pulling on the magazine with your fingers to get the magazine out.  Is there any way I can fix this or is it just a "feature" of the gun?

It looks like, in general, the mag release will "drag" on the magazine once you've released it. There is a decent video below with a simple modification (a piece of paracord looped through the mag release, you can also use a keyring) that might help get you a "drop free" release if that's what you're looking for. I've also linked a second video showing the general method for magazine changes where one commenter claims it's the same method taught to Russian police and military (YMMV).
