## Why is the BATFE blocking import of the Glock 25 to the US?

It seems pretty counterintuitive that the Glock 25 (.380) would be banned when numerous more powerful models are allowed. What reason does BATFE give for this? What rule actually bans the Glock 25?

The <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/how-to/import-firearms-ammo-implements-of-war.html">ATF rules</a> for importing pistols include a point system based on the features and functions of a given firearm. A minimum score of 75 points is required, and because of the way the Glock 25 is built it does not meet this minimum. The blowback operating system of the pistol (5 points missed for no locking breech) combined with the caliber (7 points missed for being under 9x19mm) makes it miss the minimum. A change to either of these would allow its import.

The point system can be seen in a <a href="http://www.atf.gov/forms/download/atf-f-5330-5.pdf">PDF</a> on the ATF website.

These pistols were really only created for people in countries that prohibit citizens from owning weapons in "military calibers".  If Glock were to manufacture these models in the US, this would not be a problem as these rules only apply to importation. I personally doubt there is any market for a gun that big in a caliber that small. There are <em>much</em> better rounds to use, let alone in a pistol that size.
