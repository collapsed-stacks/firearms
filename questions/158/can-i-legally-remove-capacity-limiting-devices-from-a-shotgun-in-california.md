I have a standard 28" 12-gauge, pump-action shotgun.

**For all intents and purposes, it's a standard, run-of-the-mill long-barrel shotgun.**

The gun came stock with a wood plug that limits the magazine to 2, 2<sup>3/4</sup>-inch cartridges. In total, it can hold 3 rounds with the plug, 6 without.

Can I **legally remove the plug** in the state of California, allowing for the shotgun to hold it's maximum capacity?
