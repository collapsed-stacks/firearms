I recently purchased a 1941 Russian SVT-40, which is a really sweet rifle. It is however missing the safety mechanism that installs behind the trigger. Does any one know where I can find one? I would also like to find some more magazines for it, but the only place I found selling them new reproduction is for $90 a piece.Anyone know of some better deals? Pic is when I got it at the LGS.
