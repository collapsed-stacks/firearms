This is a two part question:

- what non-lead material can be used when casting bullets at home? 
 - eg, could tungsten 'inserts' be placed in the molds to create a bullet that would be nominally-similar to a steel-core round?
- when using non-lead material(s) in a bullet *along with* lead, what would be the best way to keep them hot so the lead doesn't prematurely cool?
