<p>These are all devices that are attached to the end of a barrel.  What exactly do they do?</p>

<ul>
<li>muzzle brake</li>
<li>compensator</li>
<li>flash hider</li>
</ul>

<p>I sometimes see a rifle advertised as having one of the above.  Are there any products that actually combine the features of two or more of these devices, or can you only have one at a time on your barrel?  Are they removable/interchangeable?</p>

<h1>Muzzle Brake</h1>

<p>A muzzle brake is a device designed to mitigate recoil. They have ports that are placed and angled to use the forward energy and expansion of the gasses inside the barrel to push the rifle forward during recoil. In this way, they reduce perceived recoil in the shooters shoulder (or hands, for pistols). They can also be designed to mitigate not just rearward felt recoil but also muzzle rise. With an effective brake a shooter can feel less recoil, and recoil will have less effect on the movement of the muzzle. Instead of "flipping" up and right, for example, the recoil will press your weapon straight back, allowing you to maintain your sights on the target.</p>

<p>Muzzle brakes are also the most common attachment point for suppressors. Many people with brakes usually run a "can" always-on with muzzle brakes.</p>

<p>Brakes are very popular in sporting events where very fast follow-up shots are important like 3-gun.</p>

<p>Muzzle brakes have the unfortunate disadvantage of increased noise and muzzle blast. Muzzle blast being the felt shock of the exiting gasses and pressure from the barrel. With a standard flash hider, they can be generally directly outward or forward of the shooter, while muzzle brakes direct them slightly rearward or very rearward. This will make shooting next to a gun with a muzzle brake very uncomfortable and <strong>very loud</strong>, again the shorter the barrel the worse this problem becomes.</p>

<h1>Flash Hiders</h1>

<p>Flash hiders are designed to reduce the bright light signature of still-burning powder exiting the barrel. The shorter the barrel, the more unburned powder remains as the round exits, the brighter the flash, and the less effective any flash hider is able to be. The longer the barrel, the more effective for the opposite reason. Flash hiders come in MANY designs, varying degrees of effectiveness. </p>

<p>Flash hiders are available as suppressor mounts, and are popular with people who want to take their "cans" on and off.</p>

<h1>Compensator</h1>

<p>These are usually muzzle brakes designed to mitigate muzzle movement over felt recoil. In the military, compensator often also refers to the A2 style "birdcage" flash hider. This term can be used interchangeably, but is likely to be too vague in most contexts and should be avoided unless there's context (for example with military weapons, which almost universally run flash hiders so saying compensator in that context would be quickly understood).</p>

<p>Compensator can also be a term used for a device that attempts to do both recoil- and flash-reduction. Devices like the <a href="http://battlecomp.com">Battle Comp</a> and <a href="http://www.knightarmco.com/mod_weapons_4.htm">Knight's Armament Triple Tap</a> fall into this category. These devices are greatly outnumbered by the number of hiders and brakes on the market. While both of these devices listed are intended to reduce muzzle flip, adjust recoil, AND mitigate flash, Knight's refers to the Triple Tap as a flash hider, while Battle Comp uses the term compensator.</p>
