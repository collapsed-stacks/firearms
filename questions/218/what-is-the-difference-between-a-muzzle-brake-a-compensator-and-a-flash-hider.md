These are all devices that are attached to the end of a barrel.  What exactly do they do?

* muzzle brake
* compensator
* flash hider

I sometimes see a rifle advertised as having one of the above.  Are there any products that actually combine the features of two or more of these devices, or can you only have one at a time on your barrel?  Are they removable/interchangeable?
