<p>I have a TOZ-78 .22 rifle.  All the magazines that came with it are plastic.  Has anyone seen magazines made of more durable materials or magazines from other arms that will function with it.</p>

<p>I know it should be the same as the Winchester Wildcat, but I have not seen any magazines other than plastic for them.</p>
