## How does the ".223 Wylde" chamber compare to .223 Rem and 5.56 NATO?

I know that a rifle chambered for .223 can shoot .223 ammunition (but not 5.56mm, despite some claims to the contrary), and a rifle chambered for 5.56mm can shoot both .223 and 5.56mm ammunition.

Then, while shopping around for parts to build my first AR-15, I come across ".223 Wylde". The claim is that the higher-pressure 5.56mm chambers are somehow "looser" than the .223 chambers, and thus have less accuracy, but .223 Wylde has the accuracy of .223 while also allowing for the higher-powered 5.56mm ammunition to be fired safely.

Can someone please explain to me why this is so, or else dispel my misconceptions if it is not? My own searches have only turned up marketing stuff, and I'm inherently distrustful of anything written by marketing types.
