When shooting a steel popper target with a handgun, there's always a risk of fragments coming back and hitting the shooter or others. I've seen recommendations for being no closer than 15 yards, but I'd like to sometimes shoot closer than that. What can I do to minimize the risk? I'm only interested in handgun rounds, either 9mm or 45ACP. So it's unlikely I'll actually crater the steel on the target. Would turning the target slightly off square help? 


Assume everyone is wearing proper eye protection, and the shooting area is appropriate for the activity (high berms and backstop, no one else around to the left or right)
