Would modifying a KSG to switch tubes automatically when the first is empty be legal in most of the US? I can't tell if they made it a manual switch-over just so it was CA/NY legal or if it's due to federal regulations.

If it is legal, has anyone heard of it being done? What would the modification involve?
