Would modifying a KSG to switch tubes automatically when the first is empty be legal in most of the US? I can't tell if they made it a manual switch-over just so it was CA/NY legal or if it's due to federal regulations.

If it is legal, has anyone heard of it being done? What would the modification involve?

As far as I know, there is currently no federal restriction on magazine capacity for pump action shotguns. I don't know about the all states, but in California, the KSG should be clear of all the Assault Weapons laws because it's not semi-automatic. However, California has a ban on magazines with a capacity greater than 10-rounds. It's not crystal clear to me if an auto-magazine-switching KSG would violate that section or not. Quoting the relevant section, 12020(c)(25): 

> (25) As used in this section, "large-capacity magazine" means any
> ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 10
> rounds, but shall not be construed to include any of the following:
> (A) A feeding device that has been permanently altered so that it
> cannot accommodate more than 10 rounds. (B) A .22 caliber tube
> ammunition feeding device. (C) A tubular magazine that is contained in
> a lever-action firearm.

I read this as intending to cover tubular magazines, providing an exemption for lever action guns but not pump (or other action) guns.
