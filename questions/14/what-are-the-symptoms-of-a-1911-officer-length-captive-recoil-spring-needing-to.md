<p>I've got an Officer's length 1911 with a captive recoil spring assembly. I know I'm supposed to replace it after a certain number of rounds, but what I would really like to know is what symptoms am I likely to see in an otherwise clean firearm that would tell me this part needs to be replaced?</p>

<p>The spring really needs to be replaced if it is failing to return to battery (i.e. go all the way forward with the next round) after firing. You'll probably also see accelerated wear along the front of the frame rails, from the slide slamming into them more forcefully than usual. </p>

<p>I think I've heard the usual round count for an officer-length spring to be around 10,000, but I'm not sure on that front.</p>
