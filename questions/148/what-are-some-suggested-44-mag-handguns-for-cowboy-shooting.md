<p>Are there some suggestions for a non-Ruger cowboy shooting appropriate .44 magnum? I already have the Ruger, but can't seem to find a more authentic/period pistol that is acceptable for the sport. I bought the Henry lever action in .44 mag and would like to stay with that round.</p>

<p>This might get downgraded for saying this, but I don't think you can get an authentic .44 Magnum as a cowboy shooter.  It was designed in the 1950's if I remember right.  I believe you can get SOME .44 cowboy shooters, but as a period shooter, I don't see how you could.</p>
