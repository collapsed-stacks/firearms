I'm looking to buy my first firearm -- a shotgun for home defense.

My biggest obstacle is that I have no place to safely fire it. I live in an apartment in a suburban area. All the ranges/shooting clubs in the area are closed to new members.

There are some state forests and parks within an hour or so (New York state). Can I find a secluded spot and legally do some target shooting? Where else can I shoot?

EDIT: I'm in upstate New York. Albany/Saratoga Springs area.
