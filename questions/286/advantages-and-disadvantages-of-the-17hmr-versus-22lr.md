<p>I have shot a .22 for years and am interested in getting some practical advice from someone who has used both the .22 and the .17 rifles. How do the two compare in performance and availability/cost of ammo? Seems like the actual rifles are about the same cost and I am thinking of using my Cabella points to get the .17 if it is a decent performing rifle for small varmints and grouse, and if the cost of operating it (ammo) is less expensive.</p>

<p>The .17HMR is a fun round to shoot.  Depending on wind conditions it is not too hard to push it out to 200 yards.  I have a Marlin 917VS and I like it although I will probably replace the trigger at some point, it is a little heavy.</p>

<p>The .17HMR has a muzzle velocity of 2550 ft/sec compared to the .22LR at 1255 ft/sec.
@200 yards the .17HMR only has a drop of about 5.5 inches where the .22LR is around 40 inches. <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/rifle_trajectory_table.htm">source</a></p>

<p>In terms of cost there is no comparison .22LR can be obtained for <a href="http://www.luckygunner.com/rimfire/22-lr-ammo">$0.03 a round</a> where as the .17HMR is around <a href="http://www.luckygunner.com/rimfire/17-hmr-ammo">$0.26 a round</a>.</p>
