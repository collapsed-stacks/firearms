I have shot a .22 for years and am interested in getting some practical advice from someone who has used both the .22 and the .17 rifles. How do the two compare in performance and availability/cost of ammo? Seems like the actual rifles are about the same cost and I am thinking of using my Cabella points to get the .17 if it is a decent performing rifle for small varmints and grouse, and if the cost of operating it (ammo) is less expensive.
