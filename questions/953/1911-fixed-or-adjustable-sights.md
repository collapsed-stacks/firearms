Considering a 1911 purchase--some of the models I'm interested in offer fixed sights or for an additional cost, adjustable sights.  I'd like to use this gun for general target (<25 yd) shooting, as well as IDPA if I become proficient enough.  Given the intended uses, are adjustable sights worth the upgrade price ($50-75 MSRP)?
