Considering a 1911 purchase--some of the models I'm interested in offer fixed sights or for an additional cost, adjustable sights.  I'd like to use this gun for general target (<25 yd) shooting, as well as IDPA if I become proficient enough.  Given the intended uses, are adjustable sights worth the upgrade price ($50-75 MSRP)?

For general shooting, fixed sights are fine.  For IDPA the most important items are accuracy and then speed.  Become familiar with your gun, know where the bullet will go each time you pull the trigger.  The best guys in IDPA are doing the same basic steps, just faster and under pressure.

I would stay away from the adjustable sights unless you're going to be doing hardcore target shooting with it, like Bullseye, etc. They're just not needed.

For everything else fixed sights are the ticket. Less expensive and much, much harder to break.
