I've heard that people can purchase used rifles from the Civilian Marksmanship Program. What is this, how does it work?

The CMP, formerly the DCM is a program where you can purchase certain models of surplus [rifles](http://www.odcmp.com/Sales/rifles.htm) such as the M1 Garand, the M1 Carbine, the M1903 and M1917 and some number of .22 rifles etc.. as well as surplus ammunition.
To purchase through the CMP, you must be over 18, a US citizen and a member of a CMP affiliated organization, legally eligible to own a firearm and, if under the age of 60, provide some proof of marksmanship or firearms related activity. See more details on eligibility requirements [here](http://www.odcmp.com/Sales/eligibility.htm)
