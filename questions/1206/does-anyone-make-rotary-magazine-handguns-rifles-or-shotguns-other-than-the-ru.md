<p>The Ruger 10-22 has a rotary magazine.</p>

<p>Do any handguns, rifles, or shotguns have rotary magazines by default, and not as add-on, Thompson-like appendages?</p>

<p>The fairly prestigious line of Manlicher-Sch√∂nauer rifles featured rotary magazines, as did the <a href="http://world.guns.ru/rifle/autoloading-rifles/usa/m1941-johnson-e.html" rel="nofollow">Johnson military rifle</a> which was narrowly beaten by the Garand design for the WWII service rifle.</p>

<p>The strange Dardick pistol used an odd magazine-fed revolving action and
I'm sure there have been others.</p>

<p>Not sure if that's exactly what you're looking for but the american <a href="http://world.guns.ru/smg/usa/calico-e.html" rel="nofollow">Calico SMG</a> and the soviet <a href="http://world.guns.ru/smg/rus/pp-19-bizon-e.html" rel="nofollow">Bizon SMG</a> have special cylindrical magazines.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/rotaryMagazine/index.html" rel="nofollow">Ruger 77</a> bolt-action rifles also use rotary magazines and are still in production.</p>
