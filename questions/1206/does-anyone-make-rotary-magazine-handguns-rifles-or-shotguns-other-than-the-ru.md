## Does anyone make rotary magazine handguns, rifles, or shotguns other than the Ruger 10-22?

The Ruger 10-22 has a rotary magazine.

Do any handguns, rifles, or shotguns have rotary magazines by default, and not as add-on, Thompson-like appendages?

The fairly prestigious line of Manlicher-Sch√∂nauer rifles featured rotary magazines, as did the [Johnson military rifle](http://world.guns.ru/rifle/autoloading-rifles/usa/m1941-johnson-e.html) which was narrowly beaten by the Garand design for the WWII service rifle.

The strange Dardick pistol used an odd magazine-fed revolving action and
I'm sure there have been others.

Not sure if that's exactly what you're looking for but the american [Calico SMG](http://world.guns.ru/smg/usa/calico-e.html) and the soviet [Bizon SMG](http://world.guns.ru/smg/rus/pp-19-bizon-e.html) have special cylindrical magazines.

The [Ruger 77](http://www.ruger.com/products/rotaryMagazine/index.html) bolt-action rifles also use rotary magazines and are still in production.
