On my Kimber Ultra (1911 pattern, officer's length). At the range, when a insert a magazine and rack/release the slide, the slide won't return to battery. The cartridge is stripped from the magazine and partially chamber. It's maybe 1/4-1/2" from complete being closed. If I bang the butt of the gun against the palm of my hand, everything gets into position. How should I troubleshoot this?

This happens FMJ "ball" ammo. The magazines are slightly dirty. That is, I've previously dropped them empty out of the gun. It doesn't happen with an identical magazine of JHP cartridges, but that magazine has probably never been dropped. While shooting I don't have any trouble with cycling, only with that first cartridge from slide lock. 

UPDATE (details from answers and comments):
It's not a new gun, it's got between 1000-2000 rounds through it.  The magazines are new Wilson Combat 7-round for the Officer's grip. There is no shock buffer. I'm wondering why it's only the first round of a full magazine from slide lock. While shooting, the gun has never failed to cycle correctly. I suspect it's that the magazines are slightly dirty, but I wanted to ask here to confirm that.
