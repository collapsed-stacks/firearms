When I went through my handgun training course, I was taught to clean the gun after every visit to the range.  How often should I clean my pistol?

It isn't required that you clean your firearm ever, but in general firearms work better when they are clean. Every round fired fouls various parts of a firearm, so cleaning after each range session is a useful guide. I've known people that clean after ever 100 rounds whether they're still at the range or not and others that clean rarely or never. In a semi-automatic pistol a dirty gun will lead malfunctions related to feeding, cycling, or inaccuracy because of gunk in the barrel.

I'm a fan of cleaning it after each range session just because I shoot at irregular intervals.  People I know that shoot multiple times a month will often just do a monthly cleaning cycle.
