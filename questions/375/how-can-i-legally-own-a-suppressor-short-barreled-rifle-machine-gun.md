I live in Columbus, Ohio, and I want to own a NFA Title II item, including:

 - a suppressor
 - a short barreled rifle (barrel less than 16 inches, OAL less than 26 inches)
 - a short barreled shotgun (barrel less than 18 inches, OAL less than 26 inches)
 - a pistol with a vertical fore grip
 - a grenade launcher
 - a grenade
 - a machine gun

How can I have fun with any of the above legally? Additionally, what if I want to become a dealer in any of the above?
