<p>I have several pistols that I would like to transfer to my cousin in Canada.  I live in the US (Pennsylvania, if it matters).</p>

<p>How do I go about shipping and legally transferring the pistols to him?  I've only asked one FFL, but he was clueless.</p>

<p>Q1. I want to buy a firearm from the US and have it sent to me in Canada.</p>

<p>A1. Any holder of a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) may import a restricted or non-restricted firearm, depending on the limitations of their PAL. However, the US control the export of most firearms (antiques and muzzle-loaders are not controlled for export) and the US must issue an export licence to the American exporter. Prior to issuing this licence the US government requires that the Canadian importer present a document from Canada allowing this proposed transaction. To satisfy that US requirement Canadian residents may apply for an International Import Certificate (IIC).</p>

<p>The following steps are involved;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>have the US seller identify the exporter - the US government requires that this exporter be a Federal Firearms Licenced (FFL) gun dealer for most exports. In many cases the US seller is an FFL dealer.  yedit from RayJ:<br>
<a href="http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/licensing/documents/DSP_83.pdf</a></p></li>
<li><p>apply to Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT) for an International Import Certificate (IIC) by calling (613) 996-2387 or by faxing your request to (613) 996-9933 and requesting blank application forms. Once completed, the form should be returned to ITCan for processing and certification. Expect this process to take 2-3 weeks. The certified document will then be returned to the applicant for onward delivery to the US exporter. There is no charge for the IIC.</p></li>
<li><p>pre-register the firearm through the Canada Firearms Centre. Pre-registration allows the importer to clear the firearm through the Canada Border Service Agency without any undue delay.</p></li>
<li><p>the US exporter will attach their copy of the IIC to their application for an export licence. In the US, applications for shotguns are administered by the Department of Commerce and for all other firearms are administered by the Department of State.</p></li>
<li><p>once the US export licence is issued the US exporter may then send the firearm to Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>the Canadian importer is responsible for declaring the value of the firearm to Canada Customs and for ensuring that all safe storage and safe transportation regulations are observed.</p></li>
<li><p>within 30 days of arrival in Canada, the importer must have the firearm verified and such verification confirmed with the Canada Firearms Centre.</p></li>

<p>Here is a company that does exporting of firearms to canada:<br>
<a href="https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopcontent.asp?type=importsteps" rel="nofollow">https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopcontent.asp?type=importsteps</a>  Steps are at the link.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a US Vendor who is selling the firearm you want to buy... can be either a business or a private individual or a US auction site like GunBroker.com... arrange a tentative purchase... and tell your US Vendor that you will be using Questar International as your "US FFL Transfer Dealer".  That is the key phrase... this way they won't be worried about export issues or the fact that you are a Canadian... since we are a US FFL holder your vendor is simply doing a regular domestic sale and shipping to another US dealer.  (The process is the same for parts and accessories... fees change slightly - see #3 below).</li>
<li>Use our on-line 3rd Party Purchase Order Form to supply us with the information required to do your paperwork and handle your import/export for you...
      *  Answer all of the questions and include detailed info...otherwise your permit may be delayed or denied;
      *  Your current PAL is mandatory... we do NOT do business with anyone who does not have a PAL;
      *  Details about the firearm(s) being imported (make, model, serial number, type of gun {shotgun, semi-auto pistol, revolver, bolt rifle, etc.}, caliber, barrel length, US Purchase Price, etc.)
      *  Name, address, e-mail, phone # and fax # for the current U.S. owner/seller;
      *  If firearm will not be "stored" at your home address then we'll need the storage address for CFC...  (your storage address CANNOT be a P.O. Box - CFC won't accept that);
      *  CFC wants a "stated purpose" for the firearm ("hunting" or "collecting" or "target/competition shooting");
      *  For Non-Restricted firearms CFC requires that we enter your Place of Birth to do the on-line transfer;
      *  For "Restricted" firearms CFC requires that we give them the name of your "Gun Club" the Club Membership Number and/or your LT-ATT#;
      *  We will require that you scan and email or fax to us an "End User/Purchaser Statement" (use the link to download) leave the IIC # blank and complete the rest. We can't process your export permit without this document;</li>
<li>Finalize payment of the applicable Import Service Fee;</li>
<li>Questar will fax / e-mail a copy of our U.S. FFL (Federal Firearms License) to your U.S. seller.  The address of our US office is on the FFL we send them and it is that info that US law requires them to use... they can't ship based on verbal directions... they legally can only ship to the address shown on the FFL we send them;</li>
<li>You pay your US Seller for the firearm and arrange for them to ship (prepaid) the firearm to the address on our U.S. Federal Firearms License.  (If you want delivery confirmation then please arrange with your US Vendor to send you the tracking data... this can easily be done at time of shipment... we do not give progress reports).</li>
<li>We apply for your IIC (International Import Certificate).  Ottawa is currently taking 1 to 5 weeks to approve IIC applications...  there is no real average timeframe.</li>
<li>We then compile all of the paperwork, transfer it to our US office and your US Export Permit application is then submitted to US State Department for approval... It usually takes 6 to 10 weeks for them to review and approve the application...  (about 8 to 12 weeks for the overall process);</li>
<li>Once all required permits are approved and received we then arrange to transport the firearm(s) to Canada and clear the shipment through Canada Customs (you will be responsible for payment of any duty and/or taxes levied by Canada Customs on your imports).</li>
<li>We will then verify and register your firearm(s) into the CFC database.
<ol>
<li>Firearm Marking Requirements legislation has been postponed until December 1st 2009</li>
<li>We'll send you a Disbursements Invoice for any duty, taxes and final shipping costs applicable on your imported firearm... when payment has been received, we will arrange for the firearm to be transferred to your name.</li>
<li>We will then arrange final shipment of the firearm to you.  Please be aware that Canada Post now requires that ALL FIREARMS be shipped via Expedited Parcel, adult signature required, no safe drop.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>IMPORTANT:  It is impossible for us to give customers step by step updates on the "progress" of their import.  Many customers call or email us asking "has my gun arrived yet at your US office" or "has my export permit been approved yet" or "when will my gun get here" or "is it here yet"?  While we understand that you're just anxious and excited, we need you to understand that it's physically and economically impossible for us to answer those questions. </p>

<p>At any given time we're handling 50 to 100 customer importations and we simply don't have the staff to answer everyone's constant inquiries.  It's like kids in the car asking "Are we there yet?"... only in our car there are over 100 kids asking us.</p>

<p>If you want to track the arrival of your purchase to our US office then ask your Vendor to insure that the shipment has tracking details (or delivery confirmation) and that he sends you copies of the tracking info on the shipment, that way you'll know that it did arrive at our office and when. </p>

<p>Once the export paperwork is approved we'll schedule transport across the border and we will contact you when your gun arrives in Canada and is being entered into the CFC database... at that time you'll be sent your Disbursements Invoice and final arrangements for transfer and shipment will be made.  Until then please understand that we simply don't have the personnel to supply progress reports.</p>

<p>Your understanding and co-operation is greatly appreciated.</p>
