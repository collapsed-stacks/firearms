<p>Does anyone make night sights for the Kel-Tec PF-9? Really it would just need the front post to glow; the rear sights aren't necessary for the purposes of a close engagement. Suggestions?</p>

<p>I've seen this question come up in a few different place and the answer is always the same. It looks like the front sight is a post mount, not a dove tail. It doesn't like there is a common aftermarket way to replace the sights, especially the front. Your best options are likely some paint-type product like <a href="http://www.brightsights.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=gunsight&amp;Product_Code=30012" rel="nofollow">BrightSights</a> or possibly a glow rod like TruGlo. </p>
