Does anyone make night sights for the Kel-Tec PF-9? Really it would just need the front post to glow; the rear sights aren't necessary for the purposes of a close engagement. Suggestions?

I've seen this question come up in a few different place and the answer is always the same. It looks like the front sight is a post mount, not a dove tail. It doesn't like there is a common aftermarket way to replace the sights, especially the front. Your best options are likely some paint-type product like [BrightSights](http://www.brightsights.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=gunsight&Product_Code=30012) or possibly a glow rod like TruGlo. 

If you're willing to do a bit of dremmel-ing, [here's a thread](http://www.thektog.org/forum/showthread.php?t=236066) from the Kel-Tec owner's forum.
