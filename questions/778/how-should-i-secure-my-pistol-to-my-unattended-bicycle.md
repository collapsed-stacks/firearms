I bike to work daily, and I have been in a couple situations where I would have liked to have a weapon with me. I am not able to bring a firearm into my workplace. So, it will have to stay with my bike.

I most often park and secure my bicycle to a rack in a well-lit, well-trafficked parking garage.

I have looked online for a pistol case for my bike&mdash;or even someone who makes customized cases&mdash;to no avail. So, can anybody suggest a good way to secure my pistol to my bicycle?
