I bike to work daily, and I have been in a couple situations where I would have liked to have a weapon with me. I am not able to bring a firearm into my workplace. So, it will have to stay with my bike.

I most often park and secure my bicycle to a rack in a well-lit, well-trafficked parking garage.

I have looked online for a pistol case for my bike&mdash;or even someone who makes customized cases&mdash;to no avail. So, can anybody suggest a good way to secure my pistol to my bicycle?

I have a hard time imagining anything that would be secure enough for this task. Because of the inherent weakness of bicycle construction, anything that you could attach, even by welding, could be defeated quickly with even a modest handsaw or pry-bar. 

Another problem you have here is that you may end up violating your state's concealed carry laws as you transition from concealed carry to storage. There is a period of time where your firearm will likely be in plain view as you move it to your storage container.

I would strongly urge you to contact an attorney about the legality of storing a firearm in a container that is effectively sitting outside in public view.

If your travel to work takes you through dangerous areas, I would recommend that you re-evaluate your route to work, or take a car. I know this is not the answer you are hoping for, but the reality of being a concealed firearm carrier is that you must modify your behavior at times, to accomodate the privilege you've been given.

My short answer to this question is "You shouldn't."

I don't think I can recommend leaving a gun with a bicycle. I just don't see how you can achieve sufficient security without being totally impractical. Any safe heavy-duty enough to deter more than curious onlookers will be a significant amount of extra weight to carry around, and it will be clear to anyone passing by that there's something valuable there. Most portable safes are made of pretty thin metal, and rely mainly on being hidden.

If you feel comfortable discussing the issue with your employer, perhaps they'd allow you to keep the gun locked in case/safe in your office.  Otherwise, I'd look into tasers, pepper spray, knives, or anything else that is legal to carry in your state and that you can bring with you into your office. 

If you're going to attempt it anyway, I'd want something that secures the safe to the rack/post/whatever independently of the bike, and goes through the firearm itself like a cable gun lock would. But I really just wouldn't do it at all personally.

I googled for things like bicycle lock box and came across these: 

http://ridethisbike.com/products/accessories/locking-hard-shell-carry-trunk.htm

http://www.otivia.com/cargocache.html

They appear to be  hard plastic and lock, securing to a rear rack. Without having one in front of me, I can't tell how hard it would be to attack. That is, it may be possible to just clip off the rear rack.

*[opinion] I wouldn't use either one of these. While I'm sort of ok storing a firearm hidden and locked in a car, I don't like that either. Having something like this on your bike could be a signal there is something valuable on your bike. However, you need to decide for yourself. [/opinion]*
