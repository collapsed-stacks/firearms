<p>Recently, a local retailer steered me toward a slightly more expensive box of 9mm ammunition and told me that the cheapest ammo they had available was "plastic coated" and would make the weapon more difficult to clean.</p>

<p>A Google search has turned up "polymer coatings," "lacquer coatings," and a few vague "plastic coated" references. However, I haven't been able to a single clear reference on bullet coatings and their pros/cons.</p>

<p>My specific question is...</p>

<p>What coatings are placed on ammunition that I should be aware of and what affect do each of the coatings have on cleaning?</p>
