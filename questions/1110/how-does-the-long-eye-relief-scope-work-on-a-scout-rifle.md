I know that the definition of a scout rifle typically includes a forward mounted scope with long eye relief. How does this work? Can all scopes be adjusted to work in this mode? If not, what is different about these scopes. Also, why would a scope setup this way be considered easier or better (IIRC, the point of a scout rifle was ease of use). What are the disadvantages to forward mounted scopes?

The optics on an intermediate eye relief (IER) scope are designed particularly to be in focus with the eye farther from the eyepiece - it is not an adjustment you can make to a 'normal' scope.  An IER scope has an extended range over which the target appears in focus compared to a standard scope.  This makes presentation (bringing the scope to the line of sight) a bit less critical.  Combined with the location on the rifle, which lets the eye track the scope into place better and you can snap the rifle into your shoulder and onto target faster than with a conventional scope.  

An additional advantage (at least to hunters who carry their rifles any distance) is that it moves the scope forward of the point at which the rifle balances, allowing the user to grasp the rifle at the point of balance - the most natural way to carry it for extended periods.

IER designs are not well suited to high magnification.  This isn't much of a disadvantage as that's not what they were designed for.  Another 'disadvantage' that really isn't inherent in the scope itself is just that many rifles do not have a means of mounting such a scope in the proper location.  Only a few commercial variants exist, then there are gunsmith-installed adapters (like the 'ching ring') to retrofit other popular designs.
