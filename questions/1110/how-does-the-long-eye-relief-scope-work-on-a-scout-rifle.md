I know that the definition of a scout rifle typically includes a forward mounted scope with long eye relief. How does this work? Can all scopes be adjusted to work in this mode? If not, what is different about these scopes. Also, why would a scope setup this way be considered easier or better (IIRC, the point of a scout rifle was ease of use). What are the disadvantages to forward mounted scopes?
