I've noticed that several of my 1911 magazines have a dimple on the follower that catches the groove of the last round of .45 ACP as it is stripped out of the magazine. It doesn't seem to affect how my gun feeds, but it makes unloading the magazine by hand a chore. What purpose does this dimple serve?
