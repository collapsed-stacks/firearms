## If my Bushmaster XM15-E2S is marked with "CAL. 223 5.56mm" is it safe to fire 5.56x45 NATO rounds with it?

<p>In the comments of another question, it was stated that Bushmaster rifles are not truly chambered in 5.56x45 NATO, but only marketed that way.</p>

<p>The receiver of this particular rifle is stamped as stated in the title, and the manual also specifies that the XM15-E2S is chambered for 5.56x45 NATO.</p>

<p>Can I use 5.56x45 NATO rounds in this rifle safely and without damaging the rifle?</p>

<p>The Bushmaster XM15-E2S is chambered for 5.56x45. It is safe to fire both .223 and 5.56x45 ammunition in it.</p>

<p>Yes it is safe to fire both the .223 and 5.56x45 out of that rifle. If the rifle was only marked .223 I would not fire 5.56x45 out of it, it would fit and fire but the 5.56 round is a higher pressure round and could damage the gun or the shooter.</p>
