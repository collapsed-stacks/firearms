## If my Bushmaster XM15-E2S is marked with "CAL. 223 5.56mm" is it safe to fire 5.56x45 NATO rounds with it?

In the comments of another question, it was stated that Bushmaster rifles are not truly chambered in 5.56x45 NATO, but only marketed that way.

The receiver of this particular rifle is stamped as stated in the title, and the manual also specifies that the XM15-E2S is chambered for 5.56x45 NATO.

Can I use 5.56x45 NATO rounds in this rifle safely and without damaging the rifle?
