In order to elaborate on Gene's answer to [Are there documented performance differences between lead-based and lead-free ammunition?](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1015/) I went looking for some sort of compilation of price comparisons. So far I haven't been able to come up with much yet. Does anyone know of a good resource for info?

I'm hoping for something that encompasses multiple brands and vendors so that it's pretty representative. Bar graphs of lead vs lead-free for categories like 12g slug, 12g #4, .30-30, .22LR would be ideal.
