<p>In order to elaborate on Gene's answer to <a href="http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1015/">Are there documented performance differences between lead-based and lead-free ammunition?</a> I went looking for some sort of compilation of price comparisons. So far I haven't been able to come up with much yet. Does anyone know of a good resource for info?</p>

<p>I'm hoping for something that encompasses multiple brands and vendors so that it's pretty representative. Bar graphs of lead vs lead-free for categories like 12g slug, 12g #4, .30-30, .22LR would be ideal.</p>

<p>Non-lead bullets compare to premium lead bullets in price. You can find lead bullets that cost more than non-lead and some non-lead bullets are close to the cheaper lead bullets. It is highly dependent on the caliber and type of bullet that you compare.</p>

<p>I've also put together an <a href="http://www.huntingwithnonlead.org/images/excel/ise.bullet_pricecomparison.xls" rel="nofollow">excel file</a> with recent prices for lead and non-lead bullets for several calibers on www.huntingwithnonlead.org. </p>

<p>Leland's answer is accurate as far as it goes. If you're someone that always buys the most expensive ammunition available, you're not going to see a big difference in price. Based on his data, steel ranges from 7% more to 7% less depending on caliber. It's the other end where you see the big differences, as shown in this graph created from the same data:</p>

<p>If you're someone who always buys the <em>cheapest</em> ammo you can find (which is a lot more like me--and, I suspect, most of us) the switch to unleaded ammo will cost you an extra 71% on average. For .223 it's only a 16% difference, but all other calibers see an increase of over 50%, topping out at 114% for 30-30.</p>

<p>Then there's the matter of availability. There's a red bar missing from the chart because between four major brands at two retailers there was no steel 45-70 ammo offered. In many other categories there was only one non-lead offering, so the selection of non-lead ammunition seems to be limited.</p>
