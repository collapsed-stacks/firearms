## Can you damage a 1911 by dropping the slide on an empty chamber?

I've run into the claim from owners of high-end 1911s (Wilson Combat, Les Baer, etc) that allowing the slide to drop on an empty chamber by either racking it back and releasing it or using the slide stop to release it will damage the weapon somehow. They were never very specific about exactly what this would damage and how, but supposedly you have to ride the slide forward when the gun is empty to avoid this damage. I respected the owners' wishes in each case as it was their gun, but I am still skeptical that a gun that can be safely fired can be damaged by releasing the slide to close on an empty chamber. Can anyone shed any light on this? Is it nonsense? Or does this actually cause damage to some part of the gun? If so, which part and how?
