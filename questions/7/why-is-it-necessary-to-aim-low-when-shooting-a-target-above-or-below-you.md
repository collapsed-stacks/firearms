Anyone who has ever tried to shoot a target that is at a substantial angle from horizontal (e.g. 30+ degrees above or below) has quickly realized that to hit it requires aiming below the target.  It makes sense to me that this would be the case when shooting at a steep downward angle, but it's not so clear why it would be when shooting upwards.  It seems to me that when shooting upwards one should have to aim high.
