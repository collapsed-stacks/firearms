<p>I'm thinking about getting a gun in the event I would need to defend myself. Something to keep in a safe place in my car and in my house. I don't really know much about guns or the different types or brands. Could somebody recommend a good reliable handgun for me? Medium size, for like around a 300-600 price range?</p>

<p>Everyone who shoots for a while has an opinion on this matter.  I'm going to try to leave my opinion out, and rather than tell you what brand / model to buy, tell you what to look for.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first, and very most important, feature of a handgun is you want one with a competent operator.  That's you.  Whether you spend $400 or $4000 on a pistol, you are not adequately prepared to use it in self defense until you've had a great deal of practice and / or training.  To paraphrase a quote by the (I think) Jeff Cooper: "Having a handgun doesn't make you armed any more than having a piano prepares you to play a concerto".  Do not make light of this requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit your 'stopping power' theory.  Some people think bigger bullets are more effective, others believe higher velocity is more important.  Because of #1, being able to afford ammo is a serious concern.  I'd suggest avoiding expensive 'exotic' calibers and stick with the common (and relatively inexpensive) calibers: 9mm, .40, .45.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a pistol that fits your hand.  First make sure you're holding it correctly - a lot of people grasp a handgun so that it recoils against their thumb, rather than into their palm.  Make sure the barrel lines up with your forearm when you hold the pistol, and pick something that's comfortable to hold that way.</p></li>
<li><p>See that you can reach the controls.  Ideally you can hit the magazine release (on an auto) or the slide stop without moving your strong hand.  (This isn't always possible, just work as close to this ideal as you can).  You shouldn't have to strain to perform routine operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a brand name.  Even with a name brand there's no guarantee, but if you find a no-name deal, it's likely to be problematic.  Glock, Kimber, Springfield, S&amp;W, Sig, etc. all make reliable firearms (and the occasional dud).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that's enough to get you started.  Some pistols you may want to look at:</p>

<p>Ruger GP100 revolver,
Kimber or Springfield 1911,
Glock in small, medium, and large frame (see what fits <em>you</em>),
S&amp;W M&amp;P,
Springfield XD,
Sig Sauer in caliber of your choice.</p>

<p>First, find a course in your area that covers handguns and handgun safety. The NRA Basic Pistol course would fit this bill.</p>

<p>I tend to suggest revolvers for people in your situation. I would look for something in the 4" barrel range, probably stainless steel, chambered in .357 magnum. You can always load it with .38 Specials for less recoil and cheaper shooting. I would suggest looking at Ruger and S&amp;W first, maybe Taurus too.</p>

<p>Big thing though is to try different ones, see what fits in your hand well, and has a wieght you feel comfortable with holding.</p>

<p>Many ranges will rent a variety of common pistols and offer basic safety training. You should be able to get a good idea of what you find comfortable to hold and operate before you purchase one. Keep in mind that a semi-automatic pistol will require you to invest some additional time in training and practice to deal with failures, malfunctions etc.. In general I'd recommend a good revolver from a reputable company for your average person looking for personal defense in a pistol size package.</p>

<p>Couldn't post a picture yet but hope this is useful!</p>

<p>In your price range, and for a first time gun owner I would personally recommend something simple, like a <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/sr9/models.html" rel="nofollow">Ruger SR9</a>. It's a 9mm with 17 capacity, slightly over 4 inch barrel and a few safety features (ambi thumb lock, as well as a loaded weapon indicator). It is also extremely easy to strip, clean &amp; reassemble. I'm extremely biased so take this review for what it's worth-it was my first gun-but I had little to no experience with handguns other than online research, and have since put over 1000 rounds through it and am very pleased. I believe it retails for $529 but any typical gun shop will sell it for less. I paid $420. Also in terms of ammo 9mm is not a bad route to take. A second option would be slightly above your listed price range, but a great choice if you want something with a little more stopping power. It's the <a href="http://www.ruger.com/products/sr1911/models.html" rel="nofollow">Ruger SR1911 .45</a> which I absolutely love. Heavier, longer barrel, smaller capacity and a little more complicated to strip and clean, but a beautiful weapon with superb accuracy. All in all Ruger has my loyalty. Oh and "Made in USA." Hope this was useful. </p>
