I'm looking at getting a double-barreled shotgun for skeet shooting, and I want to know what characteristics I should consider when deciding which gun to get.

For any sort of sport shooting the most important thing is the fit of the gun.  Any good gunsmith would be able to fit you for a gun that would work best.

I would also make sure that the gun is solidly built because you will be putting many rounds through it.  Also make sure it locks up tight.

One last thing you might want to look at because I see that your question is tagged `skeet` if you are looking to do multiple types of sport shooting you might want removable chokes.  I believe that a lot of skeet guns have at least one fixed choke.
