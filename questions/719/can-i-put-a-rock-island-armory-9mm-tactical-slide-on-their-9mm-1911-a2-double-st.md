Are the frame rails the same width, etc. on a Rock Island Armory 9mm 1911-A1 tactical and a 9mm 1911-A2 double stack so that a tactical slide could be swapped onto the 1911-A2?

I must preface my answer by stating that I have no experience with the RIA models mentioned.  Most (I think all) 1911 style pistols that I have worked on have identical rails and are amenable to swapping, with the understanding that there are various peening and slide tightening schemes that may result in a slide being too tight (or very loose) on one frame, when moved from another.  This is less of a concern with modern manufacture and I'd expect a pretty good fit out of the box.
