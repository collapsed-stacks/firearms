If I'm understanding things correctly, rifles with a barrel less than 16" or an overall length less than 26" are classified as short-barreled rifles. The SU-16C is 25.5" when folded, according to Kel-Tec's website.

It seems like Kel-Tec would have to be awfully clueless to come up 1/2" short on this. Is there some other technicality that makes these rifles legal?
