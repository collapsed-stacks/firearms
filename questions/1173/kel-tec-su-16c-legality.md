If I'm understanding things correctly, rifles with a barrel less than 16" or an overall length less than 26" are classified as short-barreled rifles. The SU-16C is 25.5" when folded, according to Kel-Tec's website.

It seems like Kel-Tec would have to be awfully clueless to come up 1/2" short on this. Is there some other technicality that makes these rifles legal?

ATF guidelines allow for a folded length <26" and not be determined a SBR.  According to [27 CFR Sec 479.11 - Meaning of Terms](http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=3075872a9bc3a57e8525cdf26f3f12a7&rgn=div6&view=text&node=27:3.0.1.2.4.2&idno=27):

> For purposes of this definition, the length of the barrel having an integral chamber(s) on a shotgun or rifle shall be determined by measuring the distance between the muzzle and the face of the bolt, breech, or breech block when closed and when the shotgun or rifle is cocked. The overall length of a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle is the distance between the extreme ends of the weapon measured along a line parallel to the center line of the bore.

So, the ATF measures from the muzzle to the extreme end of the open/extended stock (as it is designed to be fired from the shoulder.)  Double check applicable state laws, as some definitions of a SBR may vary state to state.

There are a few letters from the ATF Tech Branch related to the measurement.  Some of these letters are related to the Uzi carbine (whose OAL <26" when folding the stock) and the Thompson Contender when in rifle configuration. While citing letters floating around the internet, nothing will satisfy an "official statement" unless it comes from the Firearms Tech Branch at the BATFE.  A passage from a relevant letter:  "Based on this description of overall length and its correct measurement, ATF has taken the position that firearms having folding or collapsible stocks are properly measured for overall length with the stock fully extended."
