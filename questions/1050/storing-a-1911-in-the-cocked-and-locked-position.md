How long can you store a 1911 in the cocked and locked position without damaging any parts? (Days/Weeks/Months)?

<p>Theoretically, forever. Springs wear out through <em>use</em>, rather than compression. Technically, your 1911 would last longer cocked and locked than if you unloaded and decocked it every night.</p>

<p>Practical consideration: if it's your carry weapon, you'll want to clean and lube it every week or so to make sure it's in good shape, and you'll want to take it to the range at least monthly to keep your skills up and make sure the gun functions. Even a cheap 1911 should last 10,000+ rounds with basic maintenance. </p>

<hr />

<p>Since it came up in comments below, I'll explain why. When a spring is compressed, it is subjected to "<strong>creep</strong>." To quote <a href="http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>, "With most of the engineering alloys used in construction at room temperature or lower, creep strain is so small at working loads that it can safely be ignored. It does not become significant until the stress intensity is approaching the fracture failure strength." </p>

<p>When a spring is worked again and again, it is subject to <strong>fatigue</strong> (<a href="http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/anal/kelly/fatigue.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>), which manifests as tiny cracks developing in the material. Fatigue is what causes springs to lose their elasticity and eventually break. That's why people worry about the round count on a gun -- the more rounds that have been through it, the more fatigue, and therefore the worse the springs are.</p>

Almost indefinitely (that is, years, and a lot of them).  I have used magazines 1911 magazines that were kept loaded for at least 20 years (found in my deceased grandfather's house long after he had passed) and they functioned fine.  Similarly, the only spring under heavy tension in the pistol itself is the mainspring.  The mainspring in a normal 1911 is never compressed past its elastic limit so it will take only a very slight 'set' and will still function fine.  Probably the biggest risk of extended storage is dirt and rust.

I'll start by saying I am not a 1911 wiz.

But the biggest problem should be spring fatigue (springs kept in tension for long periods of time lose their springiness). The same problem occurs with loaded magazines. So, the answer is - it depends. Modern metallurgy creates springs that are less subject to fatigue. A newer gun can easily go months without a problem, an older gun far less (still measured in weeks). 

All that said, I still remove tension from all my actions whenever I store a gun, and swap my loaded magazines every 3 months or so. Better safe than sorry. Or as my Grandpa used to say: "Your pants won't fall down when you wear a belt and suspenders"
