I'm considering purchasing a [North American Arms 22 mini-revolver](http://www.northamericanarms.com/firearms/lr/lr-hg.html). I'm aware this isn't a one-shot-stop weapon.  It's mostly to cover the first rule of a gunfight, so I'm not looking for the pros and cons of its merits for self-defense.  I'd like to know what experiences people have had with the holster grip configuration, like so:

It still seems too exposed to lint and hammer snags to just put it in your pocket like this, so what's the benefit?  Does anyone actually carry it without an additional pocket holster?  Or is it mostly to reduce the "gun shape" so you can use a smaller, more innocuous-looking rectangular belt pouch or something?  After it gets some wear, does it lock open reliably enough to feel like it won't close on your hand?  I realize any gun this small won't feel like a natural fit, but does the holster opening and shape make it feel too foreign in your hand?

I haven't played with that particular pistol, but I tried a 'grip clip' on a compact Kimber (.45) and found it wanting.  The fundamental problem was presenting the grip at the same location repeatedly, which it did not.  It's better than not having a gun (rule #1), but there's got to be a better way...
