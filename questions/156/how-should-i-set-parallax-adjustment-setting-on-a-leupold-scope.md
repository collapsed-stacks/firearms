<p>I recently bought a Leupold scope with parallax adjustment.  Being able to remove this small source of error is nice, but it requires a stable position and a bit of time.  On some shots at fleeting targets these aren't available.  Where should I keep the parallax adjustment set for snap shooting?</p>

<p>You are most likely to be taking quick shots at closer range, so I'd pre-set the parallax to 100y or 50y.  In the event of a longer distance shot you'll have time to set the parallax accordingly.</p>

<p>You didn't say which model you have, but most scopes with a parallax adjustment on the front (objective) lens will have numbers indicating (approximately) the zero-parallax setting for different yardages.  While those numbers can't be counted on the be exactly calibrated, in practice they are usually pretty close (and when you are shooting from a bench at a range, you can carefully check this and establish for yourself if the markings are "close enough" or not).</p>

<p>Most side-parallax scopes seem to not have a numeric scale.  On my Leupold side-focus target scope I've put a small piece of tape around where the knob needs to be for 100 yards and another small piece of tape where it needs to be for 1000 yards.  Yes it looks about as elegant as it sounds but it does work.  If shooting at 600 you can eyeball the position pretty closely to start, and then fine-tune it the usual way if needed.</p>

<p>That needs to be set at whatever you are shooting at.  Just look at your average distance and set it there.  If you take 3 shots at 150, 200, and 250; then set your parallax to 200.  For deer and stuff, I would do a quick mental guess, switch your parallax to the proper setting, and take aim.  It takes an extra 2 seconds and if the deer's not already running off, you've got that time.</p>

<p>Editing to add that the parallax makes more of a difference the farther out your target is.  If it's in close, besides the lack of focus, the crosshairs will be closer to center.</p>
