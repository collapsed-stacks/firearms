<p>I currently hunt waterfowl with an over/under.  I use an improved cylinder on the bottom barrel and a modified on the top barrel.  Recently I have seen <em>decoy</em> and <em>pass</em> chokes for waterfowl hunting.  How do those chokes compare to standard IC and M chokes?</p>

<p>I would assume they are very similar but have not seen ranges on ether.</p>

<p>I can't find consistent measurements for these specialty chokes, it seems every manufacturer builds them with slightly different constriction. The idea behind these waterfowl chokes is that they'll both work with steel-shot. </p>

<p>The decoy chokes seem to be about about .110-.114" of constriction , which puts them between  an improved cylinder and light modified choke. Common wisdom on the decoy choke is that it will maintain a tight pattern out to about 35 yards. It's intended to be used over decoys.</p>

<p>The pass chokes run  about .180-.200", which puts them between a light modified and a modified choke, they're supposed to be used in pass shooting, with the pattern holding tight out to 50yds. </p>

<p>As always, shotgun patterns vary with gun, choke, and load. You need to pattern your gun with your choice of choke and load to see what it's really doing.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to get an assortment of chokes and ammunition and head to the range.</p>
