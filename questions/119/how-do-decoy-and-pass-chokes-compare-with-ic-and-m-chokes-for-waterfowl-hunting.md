I currently hunt waterfowl with an over/under.  I use an improved cylinder on the bottom barrel and a modified on the top barrel.  Recently I have seen _decoy_ and _pass_ chokes for waterfowl hunting.  How do those chokes compare to standard IC and M chokes?

I would assume they are very similar but have not seen ranges on ether.
