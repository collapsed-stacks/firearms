There seem to be a *lot* of different names for ammunition in the 9mm caliber. Can anyone explain which names refer to "common" 9mm and which refer to other 9mm rounds? A few I've come across are 9x19, parabellum, short, 9x18, lugar, 9x23, NATO, 9x18 ultra, browning, mauser, 9x19 glisenti, patronen, makarov--a comprehensive answer with all the different names people can think of would help me and a lot of other people.
