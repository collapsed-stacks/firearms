Lets consider .22 LR, .22 WMR and .223 as an example (or 44 Mag vs 44 SPL vs 45 ACP for that matter). FMJ ammo of those calibers will,presumably, go through in many cases when torso is hit. So they should leave a channel of approximately the same diameter. So are they different in stopping/lethal power? If so why?
