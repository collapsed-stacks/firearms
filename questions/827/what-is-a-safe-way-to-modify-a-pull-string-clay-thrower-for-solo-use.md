Is there an inexpensive but still safe way to modify pull string clay target throwers like the [do-all competitor](http://www.do-alltraps.com/sportingclays/productinfo/compet.html) so the shooter can release with his foot like the more expensive models?

<p>Lay a piece of plywood 18" x 6" flat.  At the front of it screw a piece of 2x4 8" long vertically and put a screw eye in the top.  Put a 12" piece of 1/2" x 6" pine so one end is ~1/2" from the vertical 2x4.  Attach a screw eye in that end of the pine. Hinge the other end  to the plywood base.  You may need a spring or sponge to support the weight of the 'pedal' (pine piece), depending on how hard your trap is to release.  Run the string from your trap through the eye in the upright and tie it off on the eye on the pedal.  Set the trigger on the trap (thrower) and back the piece off until the string is taut.  At that point, stepping on the pedal should release the trap.</p>
