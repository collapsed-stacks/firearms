If I get an AK that already has the brackets on the left side of the receiver, do I need to worry about compatibility at all, or can I get anything that says "AK scope mount"? Are they the same for AK-47s and AK-74s?

Any AK side rail mount should be compatible with any AK. Be aware that it tends to be very difficult to get a good cheek weld on an AK, because the optic will ride so high.
