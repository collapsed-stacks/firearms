<p>Someone told me that you should not use slugs with a modified or full choke barrel. Is that true? I have 12 gauge shotgun with modified choke and have shot a few slugs before, but I haven't seen any problems with the barrel.</p>

<p>You should be OK from a modified choke. It will slow the slug down a little, hurting both your range and accuracy, But your gun should be fine.</p>

<p>A slug should be safe down to a 'full' choke.  In fact best accuracy is usually obtained with a modified or full choke.  Using tighter chokes ('extra full', 'turkey', etc. may damage the choke or barrel)  Additionally some replaceable (screw in) chokes (older - I don't know of any currently manufactured) may also be damaged by slugs, but were normally labeled with warnings.</p>
