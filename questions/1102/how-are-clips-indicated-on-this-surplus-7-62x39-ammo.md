On these 7.62x39 crates, which of the markings indicate that the ammo is or isn't on clips? (This is a more specific version of [my other question](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/1099/how-are-clips-indicated-on-russian-surplus-ammo-crates) because I didn't want to invalidate the good answer given to my broader question.) After more research Google thinks these crates are labeled in Croatian.

From what I've been able to figure out using Google Translate:

 - "комада" means "pieces", as in number of rounds
 - "метака са обичним зрном" means "cartridges with ordinary bullets" (as opposed to incendiary, armor piercing, tracer, etc)
 - "и месинганом чауром" means it's brass cased
 - "Бруто" means "gross", as in the total weight

which leaves "у оквирима" which comes back as "within the" as about the only option to mean "on clips". I'd also come across "без оквира" ("no frame") which for a while had me believing they only marked ammo that *wasn't* on clips. Anyone know the real story here?

<p>I played with <a href="http://imtranslator.net" rel="nofollow">imtranslator.net</a> translating <em>метак са обичним зрном и месинганом чауром у оквирима</em>.</p>

<p>Croatian to English translation yields <em>shot with a regular bullet and brass cartridge case in the framework</em> and Croatian to Russian translation yields <em>выстрел с регулярными пули и латунный корпус картриджа в рамках</em> which means <em>shot with regular bullets and brass cartridge case in frames</em>.</p>

<p>This makes me believe that indeed <em>у оквирима</em> means <em>in clips</em>.</p>
