Surely Dirty Harry carried his Smith & Wesson Model 29 concealed and it's surely fun to shoot 44 Magnum. But what would be real practical uses for such large pistol? Hunting? What game?

When I lived in Pennsylvania, I knew of hunters who use handguns. Both 44 mag and 357 mag revolvers are good choices for deer or black bear. Semi autos were not legal for hunting in Pennsylvania. Handguns are not legal for hunting in some states such a New York that only allows shotguns for deer.

Handgun hunting is a sport unto its own, and an 8" M29 (.44 Magnum) is certainly a decent hunting pistol.  In my area it would be good for deer or cougar.

Long-range target shooting also, especially steel-target "silhouette" shooting.

Defense against wild animals.  I occasionally work at rallyes that are way out in the middle of nowhere in the forests.  You're out there by yourself for hours on end waiting for the stages to come up, and then to do the teardown.  There's occasional driving around to different locations.  What you really want is a rifle, but since having a loaded rifle (loaded magazine counts as "loaded rifle") in the car is illegal (and continually loading/unloading everytime you move around would be a challenge), you want a nice big handgun as that IS legal to keep loaded...
