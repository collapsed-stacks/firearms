## Which sights are better for bifocal wearers?

I notice that as my near eyesight changes, focusing on traditional iron sights is becoming harder. I'd appreciate some recommendations for sighting systems that specifically address this issue in older shooters. This is really a problem with handguns and I'm not that keen on laser sights (like Crimson Trace). Am I limited to using scopes and red dot sights? The latter systems tend to have a higher profile than I like on a pistol.
