<p>What are the typical and maximum life cycles for brass for a given cartridge for reloading purposes? </p>

<p>Is there a hard-and-fast rule to never exceed? Does it vary per manufacturer? Does it vary per caliber? </p>

<p>There is no hard and fast rule.  It varies by caliber and loading.  In general, pistol calibers will last longer than rifle calibers, lower pressure calibers will last longer than higher pressure ones, and lighter loadings will allow more re-uses than heavier loadings will.  </p>

<p>"It depends" (sorry!).</p>

<p>There is not a hard-and-fast, "never exceed" rule, rather, it is done "on condition".  A good reloading manual will describe the signs that indicate when it is time to cull the brass.</p>

<p>.38 Special and .45 ACP brass usually gets lost before it gets worn out.</p>

<p>With rifle cartridges,there are two ways a case can fail due to use:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the case is full-length sized improperly, then every firing cycle can cause the case the stretch by 5thou-10 thou.  This causes the case wall to thin, to the point of failure.  This can happen in as few as 3-10 firings.</p></li>
<li><p>properly cared for, rifle brass can get 10, 20 or even 40 firings.  The limiting factor is that on each firing cycle, the neck of the case expands about 10 thou in diameter, and then is sized back down about 15 thou.  Eventually the brass will work-harden and the necks will crack.</p></li>
</ul>
