When I started shooting, I used Tetra Gun Grease on everything (mostly Beretta Neos and Mosin Nagant bolt). When I bought my first 1911, a Kimber, the manual specifically said to use CLP oil. I do the same with my current 1911 (an STI) and my AR-15. With the rest of my guns, I use grease on sliding parts and oil on rotating parts. 

I imagine lubrication methods should vary from gun to gun. Does anyone have any guidance for the 1911, or in general?
