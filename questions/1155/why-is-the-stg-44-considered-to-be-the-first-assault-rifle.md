The German StG 44 seems to be one of the most interesting and influential small arms of the World War II era. Why was it so influential, and what features or technology separated it from  other semi-automatic firearms of the time, like the MP40 or Browning BAR?

Main characteristics of an *assault rifle* might be summed up like this:

* More compact than a full length rifle but still accurate enough
* Semiautomatic with option of full automatic fire
* Detachable magazine with big capacity
* Smaller cartridge than standard rifle round - enough stopping power and effective range in a small package and lower recoil

In my opinion, the last point is the most important that made this weapon category to what it is today - the standard weapon of most infantry soldiers.  
It brings the ability to carry more ammunition, being able to reload quickly but still being able to hit relatively far targets with lethal force.

The other firearms you mention lack some of these attributes. MP40 (which is 9mm Luger) doesn't have the power of bigger rifle cartridges (not to mention it's inaccuracy on longer distances). BAR is simply too strong for an average soldier - bigger recoil makes it harder to handle and heavier ammunition means less ammo carried.  
This doesn't mean these weapons are worse than _assault rifles_ but they're meant for different application.

Even today, the most interesting innovations in this field are arguably the new cartridges - it's a never ending struggle between enough stopping power, penetration and effective range vs. size and weight of the cartridge.

It is considered to be the first assault rifle because when Hitler was shown a field test of the weapons prototype he was extremely impressed with it and he called it the "Sturmgewehr" which translates into "storm/assault rifle".
