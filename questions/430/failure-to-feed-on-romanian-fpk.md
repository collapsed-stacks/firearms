I recently bought a new Romanian FPK â€” essentially an enlarged AK-47 that's chambered in 7.62x54R and uses 10 round magazines (everything functions the same as on an AK, just bigger). I've had several failures to feed. Not <em>a lot</em>, but out of the 70-100 rounds that I've put through it, I've probably had at least 15 failures to feed.  I know that the military surplus ammo I use occasionally has a rim that's too large because it will fail to feed on my Mosin Nagants as well, but I was wondering if there were any other things I could check on the rifle to see if that helps with the problem?

See if you can narrow it down to a specific magazine. Sometimes the surplus mags have issues.
