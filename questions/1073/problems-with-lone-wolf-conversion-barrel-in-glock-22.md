I tried my new Lone Wolf 40-9 conversion barrel in my gen 4 Glock 22 yesterday with some PMC 115gr FMJ ammo. Unfortunately I had all sorts of problems--stovepiping, rounds being pinched tip-up between the feed ramp and slide, rounds nose-diving in the magazine, and the slide not locking back when the magazine was empty. Do I need to send this thing back or is there something I can do?
