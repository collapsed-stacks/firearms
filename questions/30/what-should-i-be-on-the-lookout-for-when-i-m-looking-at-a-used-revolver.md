<p>If I'm looking at purchasing a used revolver, what should be on the lookout for to determine if the gun is in pretty good shape? Let's assume I won't be allowed to fire it before purchasing.</p>

<p>There's a lot to look out for:
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/revocheck" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/revocheck</a> (link to 12 page Google doc of detailed information)</p>

<p>The summary (further revised by kbyrd) from page 12 of "Revolver Checkout", 2011 Revised Edition by Jim March:</p>

<p><strong>SAFETY FIRST!</strong>  Make sure it's unloaded and always, always watch your muzzle direction!</p>

<p>Get the cylinder swung open, removed, or whatever else it takes to get to a point where you see the back of the barrel.</p>

<p>External once-over - look for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boogered screws.</p></li>
<li><p>Cracks: pay particular attention to the back of the barrel and the frame where the barrels goes in.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper fit at any place there are metal-to-metal edges.</p></li>
<li><p>Look under the "topstrap" just over the barrel for signs of flame-cutting.  A little is OK on a steel gun but does indicate wear/age.  It's bad on anything aluminum or scandium/aluminum.  Look to see if a small "heat shield" has gone missing!</p></li>
<li><p>Check the barrel.  You need a light at one end - look for bulges, pitting, nicks, especially near the muzzle. Look for signs of cracks or erosion at the back of the barrel.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the cylinder's "star" at the rear: make sure it's cleanly machined, not chewed-up looking.</p></li>
<li><p>Check each cylinder bore like it was a small barrel.  Smooth is good.  Erosion at the business end isn't.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the gun reassembled and unloaded, cock it, then lower the hammer with the trigger still held back.  This is "full lockup" - the state the gun will be at during firing.  Check the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the cylinder doesn't wiggle front/back (parallel to the barrel) - that is called endshake, which is bad.  A tiny amount is OK, especially with a lesser caliber, steel gun or both.  In a stout caliber and/or a lightweight gun (especially aluminum/scandium/magnesium) it is  a scary thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Check for "rotational wiggle".  A little is OK on S&amp;Ws (all), Rugers (all), Taurus/Rossi, anything Italian, etc.  On double-action Colt revolvers there is supposed to be zero rotational play.</p></li>
<li><p>Shine a strong light right at the firing pin behind the cylinder and look down the barrel.  Don't see any light?  <strong>UNLOAD</strong> it. You want to see the cylinder bore on each chamber (done one at a time) line up behind the barrel in a "circle behind a circle"
effect.  It's easy to spot.  If it's off a fraction and it's one of the "loose rotational lockup" guns (S&amp;W/Ruger/etc.) see if it's
possible to "nudge" the cylinder into alignment.  If so, the gun is safe to shoot but will take a small accuracy hit.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the gap between barrel and cylinder.  Hold it up to a light - is it even top to bottom?  Use a feeler gauge set - .002 is
minimal, .003" to .004" optimal on most guns esp. snubbies or anything where you need max velocity, beyond .006" I'd be
unhappy with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag one finger gently on the cylinder while slowly cocking it.  Make sure the gun pushed the cylinder completely into it's
next "click".</p></li>
<li><p>Cock it, wiggle the hammer, make sure it doesn't slip off.  </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that pulling your finger off the trigger causes the firing pin to retract, if the gun has a hammer block or transfer
bar safety!  You can usually see the firing pin with the trigger pulled and the hammer down, if you hold it up to a light
sideways.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull the grip panels, look for signs of crude mainspring alteration, rust, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Check anything specific to the gun type, such as Ruger "transfer bar pinch" issues, breakopen hinge looseness, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Condition of bluing (if the gun is blued)</li>
<li>You'll want to look inside the barrel to see what kind of wear and tear it has</li>
<li>Condition of the muzzle (how worn it is)</li>
</ul>

<p>From a mechanical standpoint, you'll want to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lockup: When the cylinder is closed, how much does it wiggle back and
forth? (none is best)    </li>
<li>Gap: How much of a gap is there between the
front of the cylinder and the back of the forcing cone? (should be
wider than a dollar bill    is thick, but less wide than a credit
card)    </li>
<li>Wear: Does the back of the cylinder have a nice circle worn
into it from some fool spinning the darn thing around too much? (this
is bad)</li>
</ul>
