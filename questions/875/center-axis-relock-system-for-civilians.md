I've been looking into the [center axis relock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Axis_Relock) system.  Even though it was designed for law enforcement and military, there are a lot of things about it that also make it appealing for civilian purposes:  a more stable platform, more instinctive defensive posture, more natural sight distance, etc.  However, professional training seems hard to come by if you aren't in law enforcement.

I realize you won't get the full benefit without training, but for those of you who have taken a class, would the basics be beneficial to practice on your own?  In other words, is it a relatively forgiving system that is still helpful if you get it close but not perfect, or is it something that will do more harm than good unless you drill a lot with professional feedback?
