I was looking at building a AR-15 style rifle chambered in 300 AAC Blackout (7.62x35mm). The cartridge is designed to feed from a standard 5.56mm STANAG-compatible magazine and lower receiver. The twist rate of a Blackout barrel is 1:8", while I have seen 7.62 NATO usually has a twist of 1:12".

My question is this: I know you can easily convert from 300 AAC Blackout to 5.56 NATO by simply changing the whole upper assembly and using the same magazine, now loaded with 5.56 ammo. But can you change the lower receiver and use a 7.62 NATO (i.e. AR-10/SR-25) lower and magazine and shoot 7.62 NATO out of it?

EDIT: After further research, the 300 AAC Blackout round uses the standard M4 (5.56mm) upper. So converting it to 7.62 NATO would necessitate changing the upper and lower. But can 7.62 NATO be shot through the 300 AAC Blackout barrel?
