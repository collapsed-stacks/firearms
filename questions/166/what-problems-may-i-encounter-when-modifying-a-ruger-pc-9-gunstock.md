I have a Ruger PC-9 that I love, but would like to put a tactical stock on it. Any comments on potential problems to look out for when modifying the current stock. Since the rifle is no longer in production, replacement stocks are non-existent.

Since the trigger group housing is part of the factory stock and the folding stocks I've seen (like [this](http://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=235432) one ) tend to be grafted on just behind that housing, I guess I would be somewhat concerned about cutting into the housing and or possibly making a mis-cut that ends up weakening the stock around the trigger group and potentially introducing malfunctions. Also, it's pretty much a one way job. If you don't like the end result, you're stuck with it unless you want some kind of "frankenstock" ;). As you mentioned, the likelihood of getting a replacement is somewhere around "none".
