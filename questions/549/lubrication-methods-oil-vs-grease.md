Wilson Combat sells both oil and grease for the use of lubricating the moving parts of firearms. In my Kimber 1911 manual it says to always use oil for lubrication, never grease.

So my question is: When and where should grease/oil be used?

Oil being lighter than grease tends to migrate away from high friction areas. My rule of thumb is to use a very light coat of grease (and the Wilson Combat product is great stuff) in areas of high friction. So, contrary to your Kimber instruction I lightly coat slide rails and barrel lugs of my 1911s. Use oil or clp everywhere else

From another answer I provided:

I don't agree with grease as a proper lubricant for firearms. When grease is used in varied applications, it is in a “closed” system where the migration of the lubricant is limited to the confines of the closed system. This closed system prevents the contamination from outside sources (dirt, dust, residue of combustion, etc) as these contaminants suspended inside the grease act as a very effective abrasive compound. As an armorer, I have seen the effects of this abrasive effect on rifles, LMGs and handguns.

Yes, liquid lubricants do migrate and evaporate. It is up to the user to ensure their firearm is properly maintained and serviceable. That may mean reapplying lubricant at regular intervals even if the gun isn't fired/used. Grease is a lazy method to decrease that inspection frequency and can significantly decrease the service life of the firearm due to accelerated wear.

The only place(s) to use grease in a 1911 are in the barrel bushing / locking cone (in a bushing-less pistol) and the other areas on the outside of the barrel.  This will make the action a bit smoother and may enhance lockup.  It may also adversely affect the pistol in extreme cold weather.  Light sewing-machine oil is best for the trigger components as it will not retard motion under any conditions.  Light oil can also work in the slide and bushing / cone but will need more frequent replenishing.
