I see guns referred to as semi-auto or full-auto, but I don't know what that means. What is the difference between a semi-auto weapon and a full-auto weapon?

A semi-automatic weapon will fire one round, and replace the spent casing with a new round once per pull of the trigger. A fully automatic weapon will continue on to fire the newly loaded round and repeat the process until the trigger is released or the ammunition is spent. 

*Edit:*
I've slightly reworded my answer to cover a couple of interesting historical asides that I thought of later. There were at least a couple of "automatic revolvers" (might be more that I'm not aware of). Still "semi-automatic" in that they fire one shot per activation of the trigger. The [Webley-Fosbery](http://world.guns.ru/handguns/double-action-revolvers/brit/webley-fosbery-e.html) and the [Mateba Model 6 Unica](http://world.guns.ru/handguns/double-action-revolvers/it/mateba-unica-6-e.html) Although they didn't *eject* the casings, they used some of the energy of the cartridge to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer instead of all of the action relying on pulling the trigger.
