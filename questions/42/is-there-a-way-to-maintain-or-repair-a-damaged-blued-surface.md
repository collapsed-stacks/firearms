I have a blued rifle that's had damage to it.  Not a lot of damage, just to the outside of the barrel.  The rifle is a .22 Winchester Wildcat (if I remember right, it's an import from a Russian TZ-78).  It's had some damage to the outside of its heavy barrel and while currently it is only cosmetic, I neither want it to spread nor get rust forming.

As with all other guns, I keep as good of care of them as I can.  I'm not worried about rust, but a friend that borrowed it was not as careful and there is a SMALL pit where some rust DID form.  Is there a way to potentially fill the pit in and reblue it?

With this being a .22, it's not as big of a deal.  It does not affect the accuracy and the pit is less than a millimeter deep.
