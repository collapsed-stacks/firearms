I purchased a Mossberg 500 shotgun a couple of days ago, and the length of the stock feels uncomfortable to me. How do I determine if the stock is too long or too short, and what the ideal length is? What are my options if I need to shorten it?

This shotgun will be primarily used for informal skeet shooting.
