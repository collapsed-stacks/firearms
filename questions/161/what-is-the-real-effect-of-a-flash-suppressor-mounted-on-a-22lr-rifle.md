<p>I see that a flash suppressor can be purchased for the Ruger 10/22. While it looks pretty gnarley, what exactly is the utility of a flash suppressor on such a small caliber? Does the .22 long have that much flash to start with? </p>

<p>On a rifle in .22 LR, it's purpose is probably exactly what you said: looking pretty gnarly.</p>

<p>Shooting my 10/22 with a naked barrel crown in the dark of night, the flash is minimal to non-existant, and certainly less than my AR with a flash hider or any of my pistols in 9mm or .45 ACP.</p>
