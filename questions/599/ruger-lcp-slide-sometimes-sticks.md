<p>This little gun seems to be pretty picky about how it is lubricated. If I get it wrong the slide can sometimes get stuck out of battery:</p>

<p>I can also cause this to happen by gently pulling the slide back until I feel it go over two little "bumps" and when I let it go it will stick where I felt the first bump. Is there anything I can polish or otherwise improve to avoid this?</p>

<hr>

<p>In response to Gene's questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>With no round chambered and no magazine inserted the first bump disappears. The second bump seems to be the barrel catching on the frame after it drops down.</li>
<li>This behavior requires an inserted magazine holding at least one round. I could feel the first bump when a round was chambered with no mag or an empty mag, but could not get it to stick.</li>
<li>Behavior was the same with all three factory magazines and both ball and hollow point ammunition</li>
<li>I could not see any obvious burrs or other wear when looking at the internals</li>
<li>I believe this has happened only once in about 500 rounds of firing. It happens more often when put into a holster or the front of the slide is otherwise bumped.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like the slide is getting stopped at the exact position you need to put it to remove the take-down pin. Perhaps check that area for burrs or carbon. Polish and give the pin a clean and see if it happens again. If you can't fix it, send it back to Ruger to get it fixed.</p>

<p>hope that helps.</p>

<p>When you're testing, is the magazine inserted?  Does the problem occur after firing a shot, or only when you rack the slide to chamber a round?  If you're riding the slide forward (retarding its advance) it may not be a problem with the pistol per se.  If it doesn't do it when no magazine is inserted, you may have a damaged or defective magazine.  If it does it when firing, and without a magazine, disassemble it and look for burrs or unusual wear in the barrel locking mechanism.  It is the lockup that you are feeling right as the slide goes into / comes out of battery.</p>

<p>When the slide sticks back, and you give it a whack and force it into battery? I had a Kimber 1911 that would do the same thing; turns out I was limp-wristing it just a skoch. Make sure you aren't doing that. Failing that, Wolf makes <a href="http://www.gunsprings.com/index.cfm?page=items&amp;cID=1&amp;mID=52" rel="nofollow">replacement recoil springs</a> for the LCP. Try an 11 lb recoil spring.</p>

<p>I have an LCP that used to do that only while there was a round in the chamber.  After 100 rounds of breaking in, you can still feel the bump, but it no longer sticks.  If you're still experiencing this after 500 rounds, I think it's time for a phone call to Ruger: 928-778-6555</p>
