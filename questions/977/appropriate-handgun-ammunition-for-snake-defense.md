<p>I hike and work in areas that contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus" rel="nofollow">Water Moccasins</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Diamondback_Rattlesnake" rel="nofollow">Eastern Diamondback Rattlers</a> and would like to carry a handgun for defense against these venomous creatures. </p>

<p>What type of handgun and what type of ammunition is most effective against snakes?  I think .40 JHP might be a bit much...</p>

<p>Trying to sight in something that close to you, that can strike quickly, just isn't practical with any slug caliber. You need something that can deny that entire area and be reasonably assured that a follow up shot (somehow Zombielands' doubletap rule comes to mind) isn't necessary. I would start with <a href="http://www.chuckhawks.com/28gauge.htm">.410 or 28 gauge</a> shotgun shell in a revolver format aka Judge.</p>

<p>You can get a shot shell in just about any regular caliber even for the .40 it seems you may already have. personally I carry a .22 derringer loaded with shot shell and seems to have worked well the 2 times I have used it.</p>

<p>Nothing quite beats birdshot from handy 12 gauge, to be honest. If you must use a handgun, since long guns can be a pain to bring on a hike, a .410 pistol like the judge or S&amp;W Governor should solve your problem. In this caliber, again, you'll want to use birdshot rather than buckshot. Even .38 shotshells will do in a pinch, and those you can fire from a .38 Special or .357 Magnum revolver.</p>

<p>As Mashashin said, your going to want to take a look at shotshell ammunition (CCI is the common brand I know of).  They make them in all sizes, and are designed for small rodents, snakes, etc.  They are not meant for any kind of self-defense, except against nature ;-).</p>
