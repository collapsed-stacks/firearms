I was told that it can damage a 1911 style pistol to release the slide on a loaded chamber by simply pressing the slide-stop <strike>release</strike> lever. I was instructed to instead pull the slide back by hand and then release it. Is this true? The reason I was given is that when the slide is pulled back by hand the slide-stop <strike>release</strike> lever slows the slide down a bit.
