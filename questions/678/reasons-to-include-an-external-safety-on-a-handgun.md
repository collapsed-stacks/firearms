Prior to entering the realm of firearms I was under the impression that all firearms (specifically hand guns) had external safeties (by this I mean a switch of some kind on the outside of the gun that prevents you from firing, not a trigger safety, etc.).  Clearly this isn't the case.  Was it ever SOP for hand guns to have external safeties and what are the reasons for including/not including one?
