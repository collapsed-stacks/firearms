I have a friend who had a DUI over 10 years ago. Ideally, this person is most interested in the Utah or Florida CCW permits because these permits are recognized by more US States than any other state CCW permit. Both permits are recognized in more than 30 US States and can be obtained locally. (i.e, an Oregon resident can obtain a Florida or Utah CCW permit from *within* Oregon).

Assuming both Florida and Utah have policies against issuing CCW permits to anyone with a past DUI conviction, what state(s) would be the most likely to issue this individual a permit and also be recognized by a majority of the U.S. States?
