I have a friend who had a DUI over 10 years ago. Ideally, this person is most interested in the Utah or Florida CCW permits because these permits are recognized by more US States than any other state CCW permit. Both permits are recognized in more than 30 US States and can be obtained locally. (i.e, an Oregon resident can obtain a Florida or Utah CCW permit from *within* Oregon).

Assuming both Florida and Utah have policies against issuing CCW permits to anyone with a past DUI conviction, what state(s) would be the most likely to issue this individual a permit and also be recognized by a majority of the U.S. States?

Each state is different.  your friend needs to take time to research each state's policies and eligibility requirements.

Florida:  http://licgweb.doacs.state.fl.us/weapons/eligible.html
  Possible Reasons for Ineligibility:  Two or more DUI convictions within the previous three years.

Utah Code: http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE53/htm/53_05_070400.htm  
(2) (a) The bureau may deny, suspend, or revoke a concealed firearm permit if the applicant or permit holder:
          (iii) has been or is convicted of an offense involving the use of alcohol;

<p>As Ray J pointed out, CCW law varies by State (as it should). The 3 big ones you should look at getting that will allow for CCW in the majority of the Union are UT, FL and NV.  NV requires (last I checked) for you to submit the application in person (along with fingerprint cards, etc), which rules that out unless you're traveling to that state. You can submit UT &amp; FL through the mail as long as you have all the paper work.</p>

<p><strong>I highly suggest this website as reference:</strong> <a href="http://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_reciprocity_maps.html" rel="nofollow">CCW Permit Reciprocity Maps</a></p>

<p>Florida CCW Information:  <a href="http://www.usacarry.com/florida_concealed_carry_permit_information.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usacarry.com/florida_concealed_carry_permit_information.html</a>
Utah CCW Information: <a href="http://www.usacarry.com/utah_concealed_carry_permit_information.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usacarry.com/utah_concealed_carry_permit_information.html</a></p>

<p><strike>I haven't looked deeper into those references and the state law, however I haven't heard of a state denying CCW if there's a DUI that's older than 10 years, so you might be able to get both UT &amp; FL.</strike></p>

<p>[Edit] According to this thread, the CCW will be denied in UT if you've had a DUI within <strong>six</strong> years: <a href="http://www.utahconcealedcarry.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7388" rel="nofollow">http://www.utahconcealedcarry.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7388</a></p>

<p>But of course it also depends on the DUI: if it was a Felony conviction then you're hosed no matter what and no matter how long. If it was a misdemeanor (and 10 years ago), then your probably OK. Ultimately, I would have your friend talk to someone who is more familiar with UT law, or does the research further to find the exact language in law.</p>
