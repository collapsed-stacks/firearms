Does anyone make a mount for a Burris FastFire II red dot reflex sight that fits on a Taurus PT-845? Burris makes a mount for a 1911-style Novak dovetail but the angles are not exactly correct. I would rather not have to machine the sight or the slide as I do not have the skill nor tools to do so. Any suggestions?
