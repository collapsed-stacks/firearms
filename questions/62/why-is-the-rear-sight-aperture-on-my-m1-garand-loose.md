<p>I received a service grade M1 from the CMP, but the rear aperture that moves up and down is loose and can be wiggled side to side. I would think this has a negative impact on accuracy. It happens throughout the entire elevation range. How can I make the rear aperture more secure and keep it from moving?</p>

<p>From what I've read, it can be the tension on the knob, the sight cover/spring or the tracks can be worn or all of the above. Try tightening the tension screws first, then check the cover/spring. A good description of checking the sight for problems can be found here:</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=16436" rel="nofollow">"OlManDow"</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run the aperture up about 20 clicks, then push forward on the aperture with your thumb - it should move against the spring pressure of the cover, and move right back when you release the thumb pressure. If not, it is a rear sight cover issue. Then push the aperture back and forth sideways - if it has significant movement, the aperture is loose in the sight base. There is a tool made to peen the side of the base right in line with the tracks for the aperture to take up that slack. I think Brownells carries it. </p>

<p>A new sight cover runs about $7. Check the gears and fit to the track and make sure everything is nicely greased while you're in there. Or, if you're feeling generous ($~150), you can just swap the whole assembly for a national match one. Of course, then you might want a new barrel, maybe a new stock. Of course you'll probably want to bed the rifle now, change the front site... What were we talking about? :D</p>
