<p>Is a C&amp;R FFL sufficient to be able to purchase firearms through the Civilian Markship Program or do other requirements such as club membership still have to be met?</p>

<p>C&amp;R license only meets the activity requirement. Affiliated organization membership is still required. The <a href="http://www.thegca.org/" rel="nofollow">Garand Collectors Association</a> (GCA) is an easy way to fulfill it. I use my C&amp;R license and California Rifle and Pistol Association membership to order. If I recall correctly, the NRA is not considered an affiliated club.</p>
