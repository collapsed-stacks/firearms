Is a C&R FFL sufficient to be able to purchase firearms through the Civilian Markship Program or do other requirements such as club membership still have to be met?

C&R license only meets the activity requirement. Affiliated organization membership is still required. The [Garand Collectors Association](http://www.thegca.org/) (GCA) is an easy way to fulfill it. I use my C&R license and California Rifle and Pistol Association membership to order. If I recall correctly, the NRA is not considered an affiliated club.
