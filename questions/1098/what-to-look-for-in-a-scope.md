I apologize if this is off topic in advance.

I am currently awaiting my PAL (Canadian) to show up in the mail, and in the mean time I am trying to stock up on some supplies. Figured it was better to spread out the cost rather then all in one.

I am debating between a Tikka T3 or Rem 700 in .223.
I've decided to purchase a scope ahead of time. What should I be looking for when evaluating a scope? For a .223, my reading tells me I'll be shooting 200 to 300 yards, so a medium (short?) range scope would be best, but are there any other features I should be looking for beyond that?

Thanks in advance.
