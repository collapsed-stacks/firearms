It have read that dry firing is generally okay for centerfire pistols.  Some even require it for field stripping.  However, my PT92 manual says, "Dry firing is bad for this firearm." What specifically about its design makes it inadvisable to do so?  Is there a reliable way to tell which pistols are safe to dry fire and which aren't without reading the manual?
