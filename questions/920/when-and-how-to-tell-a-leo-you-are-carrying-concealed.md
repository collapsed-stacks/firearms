I'm not asking for a legal opinion here.  Obviously different jurisdictions may have different minimum requirements, but assume for the purposes of this question you have no legal obligation without a search warrant.  What I'm wondering is what is the best time and way to inform a law enforcement officer during a routine stop that you are carrying concealed so as not to end up face down with your hands behind your back and/or shot.  I want to be respectful, but at the same time we've all heard horror stories about law abiding citizens being mistreated.  What's the best way to avoid that?
