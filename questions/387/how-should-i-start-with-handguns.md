I never owned a handgun, though I occasionally shot some (and other guns, e.g. M-16). I would like to get a handgun for myself and learn how to use it properly - primarily for self-defense but also maybe for self-improvement (i.e. satisfaction of knowing I could shoot accurately - if I could achieve that). I know the basics and I have the gun safety certificate required by California state, but I am a bit lost about how to proceed. E.g., the following:

1. How would I choose which gun I should get? 
2. How is it best to start training - I'd like to get some guidance and training, but not sure where to look for one.
3. Anything you would advise a new gun owner to pay attention too?

I understand it's a big question to ask which can have multiple answers but I hope the experience of the people here could help me.
