<p>I have a small regular vise I would like to use to secure firearms when working on them, but I'm pretty sure those metal teeth would not be good for my weapons.  What can I use to pad it or otherwise make it safe for use on firearms (both wood and metal)?</p>

<p>For working with both metal and wood you'll probably want something like rubber or leather vice jaw pads.   You can probably find them anywhere that sells gunsmith supplies, like Brownells.  </p>

<p>There are various "vice blocks" available for specific firearms. Something else you can do, depending on the size of your vice, is make your own from some scrap 2x4's bound together and drilled down the center lengthwise to the appropriate size for the barrel you're working on.</p>
