I tried to shoot my new Mosin Nagant 91/30 today. Very first round got stuck and couldn't be ejected with the bolt. Somehow I managed to open it and push out the casing with a rod. Following rounds didn't get stuck so badly but every time I had to bump the bolt hard to eject.

So I wonder if something need to be adjusted in the rifle or if it is an ammo problem. I used some cheap surplus ammo in green steel casings with no clear marking. I picked that up on gun show.

Any recommendation on how to fix it?
