I've had some miscellaneous ammo laying around for some years (for weapons I no longer own). How can I safely dispose of the ammunition?

Most local police departments will accept ammunition. Call ahead of time to check. When you arrive, leave it in the car, walk in and tell the desk sergeant or greeter what you would like to do and ask him how you should proceed. 

**Before you contact police, you should be sure that the ammunition you have is legal to posses in your jurisdiction.**

I don't think the ammunition can get too old. And if it does, it already must be of interest to the cartridge collectors.

As for the misfired ammo - if it's not worth it to safely dissasembly the cartridges, I'd give them to the supervisor of the shooting range I just happen to be shooting at.

Use a bullet puller to carefully disassemble the cartridge. You can probably dispose of the gunpowder at a city/county/state "hazmat" disposal site or event.

Aside from police departments, many shooting ranges and some gun stores will also allow you to get rid of ammo.  They might make you pay, but not always.

For misfires, you can get a bullet puller for under $20 from your favorite shooting supply website, once you pull it, dump the powder in your garden. If you want to truly make it safe, put the empty case in your gun and fire the primer.

As for old ammo, unless it is corroded or physically damaged, shoot it... I have fired pre-WWII surplus ammo many times without any problems.

most factory ammo takes care of you like you take care of it...cool dry storage.As far as milatary surplus...if a cartridge fails to fire...aproach with extreme caution...keep muzzle pointed down range and leave it alone for a while and wait.
