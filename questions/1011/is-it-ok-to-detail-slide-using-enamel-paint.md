<p>I want to detail the Walther logo on my new PPQ. Is it OK to use enamel paint such as the one below to do the job?  If it is OK to use, is there any prep work that needs to be done before applying the paint?</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0035LLBZO" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Testors-Enamel-Bottle-Gloss-White/dp/B0035LLBZO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328541230&amp;sr=8-1</a></p>

<p>So a video that cam up along w/ the suggested comment, demoed exactly what I was looking for.  Testors enamel paint and mineral spirits are just fine to use.  Unfortunately, the slide of the walther ppq makes it nearly impossible to detail the front logo, leaving only the PPQ, which, looks like total crap when detailed : /</p>

<p>The product you are linking to is similar to the nail enamel Jack mentions, and should work for your intended purpose.
However, I disagree with Jack on the you getting it off with remover. If it was a BLUED surface, that would be true. Your PPQ has a Tenifer coating, and I am guessing removing your art won't be as simple. </p>

<p>Prep - just make sure you have the surface fully degreased (denatured alcohol works well). </p>
