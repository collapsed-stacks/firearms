I shoot at an outdoor range that requests that we pick up our casings.  I currently spent ten to thirty minutes cleaning up after firing.  The handgun I shoot does not drop brass in the same spot so I also have to wander all over the bay looking for it.  *In addition* many others *don't* pick up their brass, so I always end up picking up twice as much as I fired.  While I like helping police up, I'd rather spend more time shooting.  

**How can I collect spent casings outside in a quick and thorough manner?**
