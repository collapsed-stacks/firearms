<p>I shoot at an outdoor range that requests that we pick up our casings.  I currently spent ten to thirty minutes cleaning up after firing.  The handgun I shoot does not drop brass in the same spot so I also have to wander all over the bay looking for it.  <em>In addition</em> many others <em>don't</em> pick up their brass, so I always end up picking up twice as much as I fired.  While I like helping police up, I'd rather spend more time shooting.  </p>

<p><strong>How can I collect spent casings outside in a quick and thorough manner?</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of schemes that work to some extent - a lot has to do with your range.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ground cloth.  The simplest solution is just a sheet spread out on your ejection side to catch spent brass.  Works best in 'bays'.</li>
<li>You can build a PVC frame and make a net bag to fit inside it to catch brass.  (Don't use cloth or it will be a sail and blow over all the time).  Fine for stationary shooting.</li>
<li>You can get a tool like the <a href="http://www.uniquetek.com/site/696296/product/T1310">Brass Wizard</a> (also sold as the "Nut Wizard" - it was originally designed for picking up nuts.  Works great except in rock.</li>
<li>Bring along a friend that's a reloader.  You can watch him clean up <em>all</em> the brass, happily.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these is a great solution - if such existed, I'm sure we'd all be using it.  </p>

<p>There are also various "brass catchers" that mount to a variety of weapons or attach to your hand. They don't seem to be particularly cheap for what they are.</p>

<p>A couple of examples for pistols (also available for rifles etc..):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sherwoodakuna.com/" rel="nofollow">"Akuna Brass catcher"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002SBBCJC" rel="nofollow">"Graco Models Brass catcher"</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have no personal experience with their effectiveness or convenience during use.</p>
