I frequent a public outdoor range where it's customary to go 10 minutes or more between checking and changing targets.  Compared to an indoor range where you can shoot a group then recall your target, I'm finding it difficult to spot where my shots are hitting.  Are there techniques to make this easier, or is it pretty much necessary to enlist a friend as a spotter?

I'm most interested for pistols at relatively short range (10 yards or so), usually 9mm if that makes a difference, but also some .22, .380 and .45.  I occasionally shoot pistols at around 20 yards or a .22 rifle at around 50.

Depending on the firearm you're using, you can try wadcutters or semi-wadcutters to make a cleaner hole that might be more visible or you can try some of the ["Shoot N C"](http://sport.birchwoodcasey.com/Targets.aspx) targets that should help with visibility.

Optics are best - binoculars, scope, or spotting scope will all let you see your hits.  Tricks like shoot-n-see targets work for course shooting, but if you put two shots together you need magnification to see what's going on.  Getting fully exotic, the Oehler Model 43 downrange acoustic target will relay your shot position to your uprange PC.

In addition to Shoot N C targets, pick up a cheap set of small binoculars. For less than 25-50yds, you should be able to see .22LR with them.
