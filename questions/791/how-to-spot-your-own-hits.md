I frequent a public outdoor range where it's customary to go 10 minutes or more between checking and changing targets.  Compared to an indoor range where you can shoot a group then recall your target, I'm finding it difficult to spot where my shots are hitting.  Are there techniques to make this easier, or is it pretty much necessary to enlist a friend as a spotter?

I'm most interested for pistols at relatively short range (10 yards or so), usually 9mm if that makes a difference, but also some .22, .380 and .45.  I occasionally shoot pistols at around 20 yards or a .22 rifle at around 50.
