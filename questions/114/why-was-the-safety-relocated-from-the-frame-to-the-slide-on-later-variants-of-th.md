From the Wikipedia article on the [Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92):

> In order to meet requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever...

Why would a law enforcement agency require this modification?

It happens that I own a Beretta 92FS and a friend of mine owns a Taurus PT92, which I understand is based on the original Beretta 92. I note that the Taurus has a frame-mounted safety, which is accesible from both sides of the pistol and also has a seperate decocking function. This means that it is possible for the Taurus to be "cocked and locked". Not so for the Beretta. Is all of that common to the original 92 or did Taurus modify the design of the safety in a different way?
