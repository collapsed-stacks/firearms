## On my 1911, should I need to use locktite on grip screws as well as grip screw bushings?

Without blue locktite, every range session resulted in slightly loose grips. I noticed it was the bushings and not the grip screws themselves, so I used blue locktite to keep the bushings in the frame of all my 1911s. With a sort of recent purchase, I notice that I need to apply locktite on the screws as well. I haven't noticed this on other pistols, just this one. I am using Alumagrip slim grips w/ matching slim bushings and screws, so maybe that's the difference?

Is there a bigger problem I need to worry about? Or should I just be content using locktite?
