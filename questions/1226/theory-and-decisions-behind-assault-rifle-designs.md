<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZX7X3pJgH8" rel="nofollow">Fundamentals of Small Arms Weapons</a> is an excellent start to understanding the workings of various firearms.  Beyond that, the notion of "assault weapons" is a misnomer.  There's no functional definition, so the term is generally applied to firearms with certain cosmetic attributes.  </p>
