I read on another forum that the reason Arsenal SGL-31s aren't available with folding stocks, while SGL-21s are, is due to some import restrictions specific to Russia. I'm assuming there's another ill-conceived point system involved as with [Why is the BATFE blocking import of the Glock 25 to the US?](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/700/why-is-the-batfe-blocking-import-of-the-glock-25-to-the-us), but I haven't been able to locate any relevant info on BATFE's site.

Anyone know where the applicable rules are? Could I put a folding stock on myself without breaking any laws?

Evidently I was just looking in the wrong places before. After tracking down the relevant codes that RayJ pointed out I discovered that SGL-31s **are** available with folding stocks (though they cost quite a bit more). Both the SGL-21 and SGL-31 come in at 27 3/8" when folded, comfortably above the 26" requirement.  According to their literature, the SGL-31 has only 9 imported parts for 922(r), including magazine, follower, and floorplate, so it appears you'd be ok to put on even an imported folding stock.

18 USC 925(d)(3) effectively is the code that bans the import of certain rifles that do not have a "sporting purpose."  The ill-conceived code is a good place to start looking and find these features that ban specific rifles from being imported to the US.
