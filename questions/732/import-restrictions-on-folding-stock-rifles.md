I read on another forum that the reason Arsenal SGL-31s aren't available with folding stocks, while SGL-21s are, is due to some import restrictions specific to Russia. I'm assuming there's another ill-conceived point system involved as with [Why is the BATFE blocking import of the Glock 25 to the US?](http://firearms.stackexchange.com/questions/700/why-is-the-batfe-blocking-import-of-the-glock-25-to-the-us), but I haven't been able to locate any relevant info on BATFE's site.

Anyone know where the applicable rules are? Could I put a folding stock on myself without breaking any laws?
