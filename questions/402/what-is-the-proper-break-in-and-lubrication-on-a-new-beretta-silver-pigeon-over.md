I just got my first over/under shotgun, a Beretta Silver Pigeon. Before shooting two rounds of trap last weekend I put some oil (that came with the gun) on the hinge points, but not sure I completely got oil on all the metal/ metal points of the break action and the forend.

My question is if I didn't properly get all the pieces oiled before shooting 50 rounds through it could I have done any harm to the gun?

Going forward I picked up some grease that seems like it'll do a better job of lubing all the pieces.  Anyone have any other suggestions on how best to take care of this going forward?
