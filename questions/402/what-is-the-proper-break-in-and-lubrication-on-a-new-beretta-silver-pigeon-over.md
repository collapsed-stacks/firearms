I just got my first over/under shotgun, a Beretta Silver Pigeon. Before shooting two rounds of trap last weekend I put some oil (that came with the gun) on the hinge points, but not sure I completely got oil on all the metal/ metal points of the break action and the forend.

My question is if I didn't properly get all the pieces oiled before shooting 50 rounds through it could I have done any harm to the gun?

Going forward I picked up some grease that seems like it'll do a better job of lubing all the pieces.  Anyone have any other suggestions on how best to take care of this going forward?

<p>When I first got my O/U I did the same.  However, I used lithium grease on any metal on metal contact points and oiled the gun down otherwise.  You should not have any issues only putting 50 rounds through you gun.</p>

<p>For maintenance I would say check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0lLdH1AEf0" rel="nofollow">this</a>.  It is a 30 minute video on cleaning your exact shotgun but it will work for all O/Us.</p>

I would think another piece of advice for long life is: don't slam the action shut! This loosens more break-open guns than anything else.
