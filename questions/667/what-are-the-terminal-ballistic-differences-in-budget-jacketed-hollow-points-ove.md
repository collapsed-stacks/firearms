There are cheap JHPs out there for less than 30 cents a round. Are these rounds significantly inferior (regarding self-defense aspects like penetration and expansion) to the dollar per round high-end ammo? If so, at what price point are there diminishing returns?

Note: I'm not asking which brand is better. Also, I am referring to pistol caliber ammunition.
