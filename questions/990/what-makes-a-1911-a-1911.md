<p>What specifically changed in 1911 to modify the history of firearms in such a way that an entire "class" of handguns is classified as 1911? Is it mechanical? Is it a style? Is it a size, caliber, or action? What are the different "types" of 1911s?</p>

<p>The M1911 was designed by John Moses Browning and adopted by the U.S. Military in the year 1911 (hence the name). It was originally made by Colt, but the patent ran out a long time ago. That, and the fact that there's still a popular demand for the gun, is why you see so many different companies making their own versions.</p>

<p>Things to look for in a classically styled 1911 are the short recoil, single-action-only operation, straight-back trigger pull, manual thumb and grip safety, and single-stack magazine. Various companies will, however, change any number of these features to differentiate themselves.</p>

<p>I don't believe there is an authoritative standard which makes a pistol a "true 1911" or not, nor is there anything resembling a governing body which certifies whether a gun is "1911-complaint" or not.  There are some pistols which have slides which are interchangeable with a standard issue M1911A but have a 12 or 14 round double-stack magazine with grip safety, but I've not seen anyone claim "50% M1911 compatible" or "M1911 slide compatible."  Absent a certifying organization or specification from the original manufacturer/inventor on what constitutes a "true 1911" the answer is "it is subjective."</p>

<p>A good write-up of the M-1911's operation can be found here: <a href="http://www.m1911.org/full_1911desc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.m1911.org/full_1911desc.htm</a></p>

<p>All models of 1911 share common components, such as the hammer, sear, and disconnector.  Variations on other components (such as trigger, slide, etc.) are of the same basic design, but perhaps scaled or cosmetically altered from the original.  </p>
