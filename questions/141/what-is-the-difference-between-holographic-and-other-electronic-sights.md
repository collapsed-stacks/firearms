<p>I recently purchased a holographic sight. But I'm told that only one manufacturer (EOTech) makes a true holographic sight. What is the difference between the EOTech sight and the other sights that project a reticle pattern on a glass lense?</p>

<p>The EOTech uses a different projection mechanism than most other non-magnified red dot sights.  The EOTech uses a laser to create the sight reticle.  Most red dot sights are reflex sights, which use an LED to project a dot on the glass of the sight.  These are basically two different ways of accomplishing pretty much the same thing.  The main difference is that reflex sights generally have a much simpler reticle (usually a single dot) while an EOTech can have a much more complex reticle design (the standard is a small dot centered inside a larger circle).  </p>

<p>Right now the only holographic sights on the market that I know of are the EOTech and the Bushnell branded sights that EOTech manufactures.</p>

<p>Reflex sights (Aimpoint and knockoffs) use a reflective coating on the objective lens (the lens in the front of the tube) to reflect a single wavelength of light from an LED back toward the shooter's eye. A reflex sight contains no laser. </p>

<p>A holographic sight (EOTech) uses a reticle is projected on your view of the target with a laser transmission hologram. The hologram is sandwiched between two panes of glass, which forms the window you look through. There is a laser in a holographic sight.</p>

<p>For a much more detailed explanation on the difference between the two sights, you can view <a href="http://ultimak.com/UnderstandingE-sights.htm" rel="nofollow">this extremely thorough document</a>.</p>
