<p>I've seen some places that tell me to run the gas piston of my SKS dry, is that correct?  I'm a car guy so seeing a dry piston running metal-on-metal is odd to me.  I just cleaned a ton of cosmoline off the piston and out of the tube and I'm wondering what I should do with it</p>

<p>Given the hot gasses that flow over the piston every time you fire, any lube you put on there is just going to get blown out or burnt up.  Runnning it dry is the appropriate thing to do.</p>
