When firing some old .22 LR ammo with my (really old) rifle, I had two misfires (pulled the trigger and nothing happened). I waited about ten seconds, then ejected them. Neither went off after I ejected them.

How long should I normally wait in this situation before ejecting the "bad" round?

It's standard to wait at least 30 seconds to ensure it is truly a bad round.
