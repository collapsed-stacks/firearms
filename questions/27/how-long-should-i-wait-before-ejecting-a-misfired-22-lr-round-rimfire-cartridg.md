<p>When firing some old .22 LR ammo with my (really old) rifle, I had two misfires (pulled the trigger and nothing happened). I waited about ten seconds, then ejected them. Neither went off after I ejected them.</p>

<p>How long should I normally wait in this situation before ejecting the "bad" round?</p>

<p>It's standard to wait at least 30 seconds to ensure it is truly a bad round.</p>
