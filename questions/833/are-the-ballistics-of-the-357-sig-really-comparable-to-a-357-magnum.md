I've read that the 357 SIG's purpose as a caliber was to match the ballistics performance of the .357 Magnum.  ([Wikipedia mentions this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.357_SIG#History), for example.)

What exactly would it entail for the ballistics to match, in terms of performance?

Does the 357 SIG really match this claim?
