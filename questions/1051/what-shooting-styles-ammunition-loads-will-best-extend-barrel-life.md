I've heard that firing high velocity rounds can drastically affect barrel life for a given caliber. Likewise, shooting non-lead ammunition can have a deleterious effect.

Are those cliches true? 

Given that one goal of firearm ownership is responsible shooting and maintenance, what will best extend the barrel life of a regular shooter firearm<sup>*</sup>?
