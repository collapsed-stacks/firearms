## Steel casing 9mm jams the slide in Glock 17. Is there anything that can be done to remedy the problem?

I bought some fairly cheap steel casing 9mm ammo. It shoots reasonable well in my Glock 17 with one exception. If I release the slide using slide release button, in every other case the slide would not close and I will have to pull it back and release again. This ammo also seem to be harder to load in magazine (but that may be subjective). The pistol operates normally when I shoot.

No problem when I shoot brass casings.

So I wonder if someone can recommend something to prevent slide getting stuck. It appears that there is more friction of steel casing against the lip. Should I lubricate it?
