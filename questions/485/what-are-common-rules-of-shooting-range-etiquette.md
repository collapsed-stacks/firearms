I'm sure we've all come across the four basic range/gun saftey rules by now:

 - RULE I: All guns are always loaded
 - RULE II: Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy
 - Rule III: Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target
 - RULE IV: Be sure of your target and what is beyond

What other rules are there or have you come across?

I'm looking for rules of etiquette rather than safety.
(ie. bowler to the left lane always goes first)

Hot Range and Cold Range are one of the most common rules for outdoor ranges. Basically, the range is always either Hot or Cold.

On a *hot* range, you can actively fire, load, unload, and otherwise handle any weapon, provided you're following the basic safety rules. But nobody can go forward of the firing line for any reason.

On a *cold* range, you can walk downrange and check or change targets, but firearms are not to be handled at all in any way. Firearms should generally be placed on the bench with their actions open so anyone can clearly see that they aren't loaded.

Rules concerning target choice are fairly common - things that will leave debris on the range are generally frowned upon. Some ranges forbid anything but paper targets. Some are fine with anything, as long as you clean up the mess.

Many ranges forbid "rapid fire" and drawing from a holster then firing. They don't want you to lose control of the weapon and shoot rounds near or above the top of the berm. Many prohibit anything full-auto, and some forbid all Title II weapons.

Shooting range-owned target stands and target movement mechanisms on indoor ranges is also against the rules, though it happens surprisingly often.

Being under the influence of any mind-altering substance is clearly a bad idea, and against the rules at every range I've ever heard of.

That's all of the fairly universal ones I can think of. Also, your rule IV is properly stated as "**Be sure of your target and what is beyond**." Most bullets will go right through anything but multiple feet of earth or masonry or inches of metal, and can be dangerous to anyone beyond.

The range I go to has a rule that states: all guns with muzzle brakes have to be at the furthest left table possible.  This ensures that your muzzle brake isn't beating the people next to you with every shot.  

Even if it's not a written rule at your range, it's still polite to keep your 7mm Mag with a muzzle brake away from someone shooting their 10/22
