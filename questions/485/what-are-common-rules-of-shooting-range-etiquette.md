I'm sure we've all come across the four basic range/gun saftey rules by now:

 - RULE I: All guns are always loaded
 - RULE II: Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy
 - Rule III: Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target
 - RULE IV: Be sure of your target and what is beyond

What other rules are there or have you come across?

I'm looking for rules of etiquette rather than safety.
(ie. bowler to the left lane always goes first)
