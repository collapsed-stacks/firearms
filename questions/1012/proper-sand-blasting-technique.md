<p>When doing a deep-clean in preparation for refinishing, I know many gun smiths use a sand blasting cabinet.</p>

<p>What is the proper technique / appropriate precautions to take in advance of sand blasting fire arm parts?</p>

<p>What parts are <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> safe to sand blast?</p>

<p>I use medium glass bead for all of my sand blasting.  Some people claim (erroneously, in my opinion) that the peening action of the beads will prevent a finish from taking, but that's never been a problem for me with anodizing, parkerizing, or bluing.  </p>

<p>There's not a lot to sandblasting "technique" other than to be patient and get an even blasted finish.  Much like spray painting something with a rattle can, it's consistent, overlapping strokes that result in an overall consistent beaded finish.</p>

<p>I would not sandblast any plastic or wood parts without understanding the effect of the blasting.  It will erode both materials pretty rapidly.  I would also avoid sandblasting the barrel crown or chamber.  The parts you absolutely should not sandblast are your sear surfaces - this is the only instance I can think of that is a matter of safety.  Other trigger components will generally be unimproved by blasting as they function best with a smooth finish.</p>

<p>Make sure you're able to completely remove the 'sand' from anything you've blasted.  Parts with deep recesses and interlocking holes require careful attention.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are considerations for particular firearms, but examples elude me at the moment.</p>
