I know that Armalite makes an AR-10 in .308. And I'm told that there are kits to convert an AR-15 to 7.62. It seems that the latter should be less expensive, but I wonder about the performance of adapting the lower power AR-15 to the higher power round. I could use some data from you all about the advantages and disadvantages of each. Or should I just invest in an AK? Is there a civilian clone of the M-110 out there?
