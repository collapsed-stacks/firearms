I've read in a few posts about a break-in period for new firearms. Can someone explain the purpose of this?

I tried relating it to when I got my first motorcycle. I was told to break it in rather gently, keep the rpm's under some value. The idea was to hone in the cylinders yada yada yada.

I tried to apply this thinking to a new pistol, but cant see this happening. It's not like I can fire the first 500 rounds "gently".

So my question is:

 1. Is there such a thing as a break in period for firearms?
 2. How is it done?
