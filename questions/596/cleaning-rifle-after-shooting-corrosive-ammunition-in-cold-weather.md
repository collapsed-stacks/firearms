I understand that I rifle needs at least a rinsing if not a complete cleaning right away after shooting corrosive ammunition. The typical recommendations I've seen are Windex or a 50/50 mix of water and ammonia. However it seems like this might be an issue in below-freezing weather. Does anything need to be done differently to prevent the cleaner from freezing inside the barrel? How did the Russians deal with this (since they're the cold-weather fighting experts)?

<p>The Russians used normal gun oil thinned with gasoline.  This combination also prevented their rifles from freezing shut - a problem many of their German foes had.</p>

I don't know what the russians did, but my plan for my mosin this winter is to use winter windshield washer fluid (won't freeze) followed by wd-40 (to displace the water) as a preventative until I can do a full cleaning.
