I understand that I rifle needs at least a rinsing if not a complete cleaning right away after shooting corrosive ammunition. The typical recommendations I've seen are Windex or a 50/50 mix of water and ammonia. However it seems like this might be an issue in below-freezing weather. Does anything need to be done differently to prevent the cleaner from freezing inside the barrel? How did the Russians deal with this (since they're the cold-weather fighting experts)?
