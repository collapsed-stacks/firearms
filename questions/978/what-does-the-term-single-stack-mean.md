<p>I don't know a lot about guns. I've seen the term single stack used a lot, but I haven't been able to find out what that means.  What does it mean when someone says a gun is single stack, or double stack, etc.?</p>

<p>Single stack refers to a style of magazine (ammunition feeding device) where the cartridges are arranged in one stack. An alternative is "double stack" where the cartridges are stacked side-by-side in the magazine.</p>

<p>It is referring to the type of magazine, which is the removable container that holds the ammunition.  Single stack magazines have the rounds lined up in a single column inside the magazine.  Double stack magazines have two columns.  Guns with single stack magazines are therefore usually thinner, and often preferred for concealment purposes or by people with smaller hands, but don't hold as many rounds as double stacks.</p>
