What does a 25 cent trigger job on a Glock entail?  I understand it to be the polishing of a specific part in the trigger mechanism, but I'm not certain of the part or what tool to use.
Also, how will it affect the trigger pull on my Glock?

It's the striker, trigger bar, connector and striker safety that need a polish. You can use a rotary tool, like a Dremel, with a polishing wheel, or just a clean rag, and some metal polish. There are a number of [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE8ZFj7qll4) and [sites](http://www.alpharubicon.com/mrpoyz/glock/) covering the process. If you are comfortable detail stripping the Glock and working with a rotary tool, it's not a labor intensive or very complex process. Make sure you do not cut into the metal or reshape the parts, the goal is to only polish the contacting surfaces. From all reports, it MAY knock a pound off the pull, but mainly it will improve the feel.
