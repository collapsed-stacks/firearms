<p>What effect does altitude have on ballistics in general? 
Will a higher altitude net a gain in muzzle velocity? A loss? No change? Effective range changes? Bullet Drop?
What would be the best standards for measuring this? </p>

<p>You can plug different altitudes into <a href="http://www.handloads.com/calc/" rel="nofollow">this calculator</a>.  Basically, you have less drag at higher altitudes, from fewer air molecules to bump into.  That means your muzzle velocity will be the same because drag hasn't had a chance to affect anything yet, but you will lose velocity more slowly, giving you a higher velocity and less drop at any given distance, and consequently farther range.  The effect will be more pronounced the farther the bullet has traveled.</p>

<p>When you look under the covers of a ballistics program (my favourite online one is <a href="http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmtraj-5.1.cgi" rel="nofollow">JBM Ballistics</a>), it ends up boiling down to three key parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>the muzzle velocity</li>
<li>the Ballistic Coefficient, also known as the "BC".  In one parameter, this lumps together the effects of bullet size, shape, mass etc.</li>
<li>the <strong>density</strong> of the air that the bullet travels through.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your question relates to the air density, since air density depends on altitude.  The other factors affecting air density are temperature, pressure and humidity.</p>

<p>An increase in altitude reduces the air density - the drag on the bullet (the force slowing it down) decreases directly proportionally to this reduction in air density.</p>

<p>Here are the effects you will observe (and a ballistics program will calculate) from a decrease in air density:
- no change in muzzle velocity
- the bullet will retain more downrange speed
- because of this, the bullet will drop (a bit) less</p>
