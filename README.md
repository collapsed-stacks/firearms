This is an archive of the **Firearms Stack Exchange** Q&A site that existed from 2011 to 2012. The official proposal and archive of the site [may be found on Stack Exchange Area 51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/164). All content is licensed under the [CC BY-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

This archive includes browsable copies of every question and answer that existed on the site at the time it was shut down. The URLs are intended
to mirror those of the original site. For example: [`https://collapsed-stacks.github.io/firearms/questions/1/what-is-the-dimple-for-on-the-follower-of-a-classic-1911-pistol-magazine`](https://collapsed-stacks.github.io/firearms/questions/1/what-is-the-dimple-for-on-the-follower-of-a-classic-1911-pistol-magazine). However, they may not match exactly in all cases.

Each page is a simple markdown file, which may be automatically rendered into a HTML template by GitHub Pages. There is [an index page listing all of the site's `questions/`](https://collapsed-stacks.github.io/firearms/questions/), but it's are more suited to consumption by robots than humans.

The `data/` directory includes a copy of contents of the official data dump from Area 51. We also add [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org) versions of every XML file for convenience. You can grab this from [GitHub at collapsed-stacks/firearms](https://github.com/collapsed-stacks/firearms).
